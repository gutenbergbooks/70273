<p class="drop-cap" id="border-right"><span class="upper-case">Old Man</span> Ledbetter came
jolting along the stony
mountain road in an ox
cart, the tin-tipped ends
of the shoe-string that confined his
plaited beard dancing upon his breast,
his hazel whipstock lying at his feet,
and a hard, stumpy hand spread out
upon either knee to hold himself
steady. Without any gee-hawing on
his part his yoked steeds turned at
the ford and staggered clumsily into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
the Junaluska. In midstream a
shallow swirl of water came circling
about his feet, but, though he
may have pressed his hands harder
upon his knees, the only perceptible
preparation he made for a
possible submerging was the shifting
of his tobacco into the other
cheek.</p>

<p>But from the footlog below, a
call, piping but authoritative, challenged
his attention.</p>

<p>“Hi, gran’daddy! he didn’t cross
the log; you reckon he waded the
branch? Dixie and me’s done lost
the trail!”</p>

<p>“Gee up,” the old man reached
for his whip and was soon upon the
sandy <em>terra firma</em> of the other side,
submissively awaiting his grandson’s
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Here, sir, here!” The puzzled
Dixie had his nose pressed down to
an equivocal impression where the
sand of the road had spread itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>through the weedy border. “Now
foller, old boy; foller I say!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="facing004" style="max-width: 40.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/facing004.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“The puzzled Dixie had his nose pressed down to an
equivocal impression where the sand of the road had
spread itself through the weedy border”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The gesture of the grimy little hand
was imperative, and Dixie sniffed
among the dried weeds; then, closely
nosing the ground, circled among
the cart wheels but, baffled, squatted
whimpering upon his haunches.</p>

<p>“You-all trackin’ a rabbit, Grover
Cleveland?” The old man facetiously
scrutinized both dog and boy.</p>

<p>In the North Carolina mountains
there were in the time of my story
and still are many namesakes of
the great democrat, but our little
hero was recognized far and wide as
the child of the party. A sturdy,
clear-eyed, true-hearted little mountaineer,
the party was proud of him
and no one ever gave him anything
less than his full Christian name.</p>

<p>He was an orphan and grandmotherless;
he and his grandfather
lived alone, with no woman to keep
them comfortable. These facts alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
would have secured for him abundant
sympathy from a simple-hearted,
kindly people; but, in addition to
these titles to favour, his grandfather
was respected as an upright man and
one of the oldest and richest residents
of the county, owning many acres
of land—not of richest quality to
be sure—but as good as any for
enumeration. So for miles around
the child was welcomed into every
mountain cabin, and no home so
poor that he was permitted to leave
it without some token of its owner’s
kindly interest, a pair of home-spun,
home-knit stockings or mittens or a
needed patch upon jacket or trousers.</p>

<p>He was a very small boy to be out
in the woods alone with his dog; for,
though the sunny slopes were warm,
deciduous foliage lay rustling or
sodden upon the ground and snow
whitened the shaded clefts and hollows
of the higher peaks. His old
soft hat covered only the back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
his head and in front of it a fringe
of blond hair bristled aggressively
above blue eyes that scintillated
with excitement. He wore clumsy
copper-toed shoes and warm stockings
wrinkled about his ankles, the
dangling ends of the parti-coloured
strings that gartered them showing
below the short patched trousers.</p>

<p>“No!” he cried disdainfully, as
if he had years ago lost interest in
small game, “it’s old Sandy Claus!
Cap’n Wiley says he’s got a den somewheres
up on the Bald. He’s been
down to the Pistopals’ meetin’-house
and left ’em a whole pack of things
and they’re a-goin’ to hang every
last one of ’em on to a tree; and
a-Chrisamus all the Pistopal girls
and boys is goin’ to pick ’em off for
keeps. But he ain’t left nary thing
for the Methdises, or the Presaterians
or the Red-Baptises or the Yaller-Baptises.
Don’t you reckon that’s
a low-down trick, gran’daddy?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
He was down yer last night agin
with another pack o’ things for ’em
and he come afoot this time for me
and Dixie’s tracked him; we’ve done
follered his tracks to the ford but
we can’t strike his trail on t’other
side. Git out, gran’daddy, and help
us!”</p>

<p>“Yaas, Grover Cleveland, granddad’ll
shore do what he kin for you,”
the old man kept a serious face
and began a clumsy descent, “but
what you aim to do when you come
on to him? You aim to clean him
out?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t goin’ to tech nary
thing ’thout he tells me; but I aim
to let on to him that the Red-Baptises
and the Yaller-Baptises and the
Presaterians is jes’ as good as the
Pistopals; and the Methdises is a
heap better’n any of ’em (you and
me is Methdises, ain’t we gran’daddy?)
and I don’t guess he’ll think
I’m a storyin’; do you gran’daddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Not if he’s as knowin’ as I take
him to be, he won’t.”</p>

<p>Gran’daddy mounted the footlog
and steadied himself by the hand rail
as he crossed, while boy and dog
scampered like squirrels ahead of
him. On the other side he pretended
to identify every print the boy discovered
as track of deer, coon, bear,
or catamount; there was nothing
indefinite that might stand for a
possible Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“He must have waded a right
smart,” there was a disappointed
quiver in the shrill treble, “so’s to
throw us off the track; you reckon
he kept to the branch as far up as
the mill, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“It looks right much like he’s just
criss-crossed first one side the branch
and then t’other; anyway he’s got the
sleight of coverin’ up his tracks. I
reckon we’ll have to give it up,
Grover Cleveland. Gran’daddy’s
powerful rushed for time to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The old man recrossed the log,
got into the wagon, and started on
his jogging way, the boy a quiet,
drooping little figure beside him.</p>

<p>“That’s a mighty low-down trick
in Old Sandy Claus to take and leave
you out, Grover Cleveland. Them
Pistopals is the no-countest critters
to be found in these yer mountings.”</p>

<p>“If I was the boss of all the meetin’-houses
I wouldn’t have any but jes’
one, so’s Old Sandy Claus ’ud have
to do ’em all alike,” the treble weakened
and the boy gazed off into the
woods with suspicious intensity.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you go to takin’-on,
Grover Cleveland; maybe you and
me can git up a Christmas tree all to
ourselves; how’d that do? I reckon
ole gran’dad’s about as rich right now
as ary somebody round yer. I’ve
just sold Copperhead Hill to the
mining company and got the money
down, two hundred and five dollars!”
For a moment the old man gloated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
in silence over his wealth, for among
these North Carolina mountaineers
commerce is mostly carried on by
barter and cash in hand is a scarce
commodity.</p>

<p>“The Pistopals’ Chrisamus tree
is only jes’ a holly”—gradually
as the new idea had possessed his
mind the limp little head had faced
front again—“I clum up into that
thar fiddle-leaf poplar that grows
front of the meetin’-house winder
and looked in, and there ain’t many
berries on it at all; there’s a heap
prettier ones in our woods.”</p>

<p>“Certainly there is, Grover Cleveland.
There’s a hundred in Whiteoak
Gulley that’s jes’ the shape of
a yaller-pine burr, and all shinin’
with berries. You and me’ll take
Butterfly and Bonaparte up thar
and we’ll haul one of them ar holly
bushes down to the house right soon,
we will.”</p>

<p>“Them Pistopals has got theirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
sot up in a box like it growed there.”
The blue eyes, though encircled with
a tale-telling sedimentary deposit,
were now lifted brightly to the kind
old face and for gran’daddy there was
no retreat.</p>

<p>“By gum, we’ll set our tree up
in a box in our t’other room like it
growed there too.”</p>

<p>“And le’s don’t jes’ you and me
have it all to ourselves, gran’daddy.
Le’s have something for Vance Long
and Harve Edney too; his pa’s a
Red Baptis’ and his ma’s a Methdis’,
but I reckon Harve’s the biggest
part Methdis’ cause he never does me
mean. And I’d be proud to put a
hymn-book on for Suly Jordan; she
sings so good and she tied up my toe
in turpentine that day I stubbed it.
And there’s Zeb’lon, old Aunt Dicey’s
gran’son—looks like he’s growed
bigger’n there’s any call for—but
he has troubles yet jes’ like little
fellers. Ole man Sumter, he shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Zeb’s tame deer last Friday, and Zeb
and me, we got to it ’fore it was plumb
dead and it looked up at Zeb, and
Zeb he cried sure-’nough tears,
he did. So you see Zeb’s only a boy
yet and I don’t want to forgit him
a-Chrisamus.”</p>

<p>“Yaas, Grover Cleveland, we’ll
have a present on that ar tree for
Zeb and Suly and for every Methdis’
boy and girl in Junaluska. There
can’t be more’n a dozen of ’em since
old man Simpson and his children
and his gran’children and all his
kinfolks left and jined the Baptises.
And you can count their mas and
their pas in too. But I’ll have to
depend on you a heap, Grover
Cleveland, gran’daddy never did
see a Christmas tree in all his
life; it’s a new institution in these
mountings. Now if your gran’ma
or your ma was alive they could
help us out o’ this scrape, but”——he
leaned over, trailed his whiplash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
in the sand and watched it
reminiscently.</p>

<p>“And there’s two or three old
women I want to remember; there’s
old Aunt Dicey, she and your gran’ma
was always close friends. I believe
I’ll put a new frock on the
Christmas tree for her. And ’way
off up in Cutter’s Cove there’s Dan
Cutter’s widow; she and your gran’ma
was girls together, a pretty pair,
too. I won’t pass her by. And just
’cross the branch from her is where
Sam Long’s got his family stowed
away. His mother—she’s a queer
ole stick as ever was—but they do
say that Sam’s wife does the old
woman mean, so I’ll give her a frock
just to show ’em all that she’s some
thought of. If them old critters
don’t see a Christmas tree this year,
the chances is they’ll die ’thout ever
seein’ one. Haw, Bonaparte! By
gum, if we’d a’ been a steam car we’d
have run plumb over old Mis’ Jimson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
cow; ’pears like she ain’t got
heart in her to get out of the way; I
reckon that pore old somebody ain’t
got enough for herself to eat, let
alone the cow. Gran’son, you jes’
get over in behind thar and heave her
out that thar corn that’s under the
bag of meal.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t she a Pistopal cow, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“I ’low she is, gran’son, but she’s
got a whole rotation of stomachs
and when they’re all hungry at once
it must give her a powerful gone
feelin’. I’ll put on a new frock for
old Mis’ Jimson. I don’t reckon
she ever had a store frock in her life
and she ain’t so old yet but what
she can turn out of her loom a frock
that’ll outwear three of the store
kind, but it’ll be a change for her.”</p>

<p>“O but, gran’daddy! gran’daddy!
them Pistopals is right mean, they
are, and ole Mis’ Jimson’s a Pistopal!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“So she is, Grover Cleveland, so
she is. I never thought of that”—for
a minute they jogged along in
silence—“I can’t somehow ’count
for that, gran’son; thar’s a mistake
somewhar—Mis’ Jimson’s a
good woman. Anyway she can’t git
down to the Pistopal meetin’-house
a-Christmas; she’s got a risin’ on
her leg.”</p>

<p>“Why, gran’daddy, old Mis’ Jimson
can’t go anywhere! She couldn’t
even git into this yer wagon so as
we-all could carry her!”</p>

<p>“I’m ’feared you’re right, Grover
Cleveland; now that’s another difficulty——”</p>

<p>“And all them other old women,
gran’daddy—how’re they going to
git down to our Chrisamus tree,
and how’re they goin’ to git back
again?”</p>

<p>“That certainly is a puzzler, gran’son.
I reckon we-all will have to
sleep on to that. If your mother was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
alive now, she’d know just how to
take hold”——the old man dropped
his elbows upon his knees, doubling
himself in sad retrospection, and the
little boy slipped off the seat in an
effort to imitate the position. On
his knees, holding to the front of
the wagon box, he solved the problem.</p>

<p>“Hi, gran’daddy!” he shouted,
clutching the old man’s trouserlegs
to help himself to his feet, “me and
you’ll stand that ar Chrisamus tree
up in the wagon and we’ll hitch
Bonaparte and Butterfly to it and
we’ll carry it round an’ pick it as
we go!”</p>

<p>“<em>That’s</em> the talk, Grover Cleveland!”
the old man brought down
upon his knee a big emphatic hand
covering there two little wincing
ones; “your ma’d have thought of
that, too.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to pass any
boy’s or girl’s house without stoppin’,
gran’daddy, even if they’s Pistopals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
I ain’t mad at ary one of ’em but
Williebelle Greenlee, and now I done
forgot what I’m mad at her for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t aim to ’lowance you,
Grover Cleveland. I aim to let
you get a stick of peppermint or
horehoun’ for every boy and girl
in Junaluska. I aim to let you show
Old Sandy how the thing ought to be
did. And I don’t reckon I’ll pass
by any old woman, either, jes’ ’cause
she’s been misled and jined the
wrong church; it’s bad enough to
lose your way without bein’ hounded
for it besides.”</p>

<p>“What makes Baptises and Methdises
an’ Presaterians an’ all them,
gran’daddy? Was they borned that
way?”</p>

<p>“You an’ me was, Grover Cleveland;
our kinfolks was Methdises
from way back before the flood I
reckon; but the rest of ’em they’re
mostly jes’ mixin’s.”</p>

<p>“When I come acrost the cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
on the mountings, I can tell by the
slits in their ears who owns ’em;
but I can’t tell what church owns
the people round yer ’thout it’s
meetin’-Sunday and I can see what
meetin’-house they’re headin’ for.
Have they got any ear-marks that
<em>you</em> know ’em by, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“No they ain’t Grover Cleveland;
they ain’t none of ’em branded
that-a-way.”</p>

<p>“What makes ’em diff’rent, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“It’s the way they b’lieve, gran’son.
The Methdises they b’lieve
in free grace and sprinklin’, and the
Baptises they b’lieve in sousin’, and
the Presaterians—they’re right
mean, they are—they b’lieve in
’lection.”</p>

<p>“Mighty nigh every somebody
round yer went to ’lection and voted
that Tuesday, gran’daddy.”</p>

<p>“So we did gran’son, so we did;
but this yer Presaterian ’lection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
is somehow diff’rent. It’s a powerful
low-down kind of ’lection—I reckon
it’s favourin’ niggers votin’.”</p>

<p>After waiting a few seconds for
this theological seed to sink deep
the old man went on.</p>

<p>“An’ them Pistopals—I’m feared
I’m a little in the dark as to their
belief—but they must be mighty
good scholars, for they kin read like
lightnin’. They kin read a psa’m
so fast that common folks can’t take
in the sense of what they’re sayin’.
And there’s another good thing about
’em: they do rev’rence the name of
the Lord in the Sunday sarvice; they
bow considdable low when they
come to it. Only it does look like
they don’t all of ’em carry their
rev’rence ’round with ’em a-week-days;
there’s Cap’n Campbell, he
can cuss considdable and he don’t
do no bowin’ when he calls on the
name of the Lord a-week-days.”</p>

<p>“Hi, gran’daddy! the storekeeper’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
wife she’s a Pistopal—and
Monday, when she was scoopin’ up a
pound of crackers for me, some mice
run out of the cracker box and she
jes’ hollered out, ‘For the Lord’s
sake!’ and she didn’t bow and she
didn’t look solemn, ary one.”</p>

<p>“Gran’son, I’ve read that there
third commandment a heap of times
and I can’t see as it provides for any
week-day privileges or indulgences.
When a man’s cussin’ mad, tain’t
so powerful ill for him to bat the old
devil’s name about some but,
Grover Cleveland, don’t you never
go to triflin’ with the name of the
Lord; that’s uncommon low down,
that is.</p>

<p>“There used to formerly be only
one kind of Baptises here and they
warshipped in the old red church.
But ole man Jordan he got his back
up and he took all his kin-people
away and he built another church
and he painted it yaller. You see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
he had a whole mountain of timber
land that he was glad to get cleared
off, and his sons run a sawmill, and
there’s a big bed of yaller ochre
right back of his house. He was
smart enough to set ’em all to work,
while they was red-hot mad. If he’d
a give ’em time to cool off, that ar
yaller meetin’-house never would
been built. They did cool off before
they got the chimbly up and to this
day they’re a tryin’ to praise the
Lord with their stovepipe a-stickin’
out the winder.”</p>

<p>“There’s too many kinds of ’em
for old Sandy to git round to ’em
all,” said the small boy persistently,
returning to his first sorrow.</p>

<p>“Sometimes it looks to me like
there’s too many kinds for the Lord
to get round to ’em all, gran’son.
There’s some big cities where there’s
more kinds than we’ve got here.
There’s two or three kinds of Meth’-dises
and there’s Free-will Baptises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and Holinesses, and they all seem to
be workin’ for the same end, only
they can’t agree to work together.
But, of course, people’s got a right
to all the religious differences they
can pay for; but here in Junaluska
we’re too poor to have so many
churches.”</p>

<p>“How did there git to be so many
kinds, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“’Twas zeal, Grover Cleveland.
And there’s another point where
gran’daddy ain’t exactly clear in his
mind. Zeal must be a good thing;
St. Paul he owned up that he had it,
and yet—I reckon zeal’s like ’lectric’ty,
it’s a powerful power for
good so long as it’s kept in leaders;
but you let ’lectric’ty go rarin’
round promiscuous and it’ll rip things
all to flinderations. Eight years ago
we had jes’ one church in Junaluska
and we had a preacher all to ourselves;
we didn’t let him starve to death
or freeze to death, ary one. He lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
down thar in my log cabin and he
had his own roastin’-ear patch and
a garden and a orchard. He had a
horse of his own and there wasn’t
a cabin in any of these mountain
gullies that he didn’t know his way
to, and there wasn’t a cabin where
he wasn’t looked up to and respected.
But by and by folks of diff’rent
b’liefs came settlin’ round here. They
was all powerful pious and they was
all bustin’ with zeal, each one for
his own ’religious denomination’ as
they called it. And—well—I
never could contrive just how they
done it—but tollable soon there was
five diff’rent churches in Junaluska
and no more religion than there was
before; unless pullin’ and haulin’
and each one tryin’ to git ahead of the
other constitutes religion, which I’m
doubtful if it do. And more’n that
there ain’t work enough nor ham and
hominy enough in Junaluska for
more than one preacher. Them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
questions of yours has set me to
studyin’, Grover Cleveland.”</p>

<p>So gran’daddy folded himself together
and “studied” the rest of the
way, while his grandson, making the
most of his little brief authority,
yelled so conflicting commands at
the puzzled oxen that they took
their head and in due time drew
the rattling old wagon safe into the
home barn yard.</p>

<p>A scarlet-beaded holly, fresh from
the forests of the North Carolina
mountains, is a Christmas Tree the
wealthiest church in Christendom
might covet. Such a one our heroes
fixed upright and firm in the shackly
old farm wagon. It seemed to grow
from a soil deeply top dressed with
corn fodder.</p>

<p>The resources of the one little store
at the village were meagre but the
genius of the decorators was not
versatile. Gran’daddy chivalrously
intended for the old women to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the best and in his eyes a new frock
was a princely gift. As for the old
men, what so appropriate and acceptable
as a paper of plug tobacco.
At this stage his ingenuity was exhausted
and his grandson did the rest.</p>

<p>If there was anything that Grover
Cleveland liked better than candy,
it was more candy, and though he
was unlearned in the letter of the
Golden Rule its spirit was inherent
in his nature. So, although the
storekeeper had laid in an extra
supply for the holiday trade (it was
all in sticks, the kind in vogue when
grandmas were little girls), when
our small Santa Claus had made his
purchases there was none left in stock
and by the time material for seventeen
calico gowns had been measured
off, the storekeeper, among whose
mental endowments the commercial
instinct was not prominent, had persuaded
himself that it was a crying
injustice that the well-filled shelves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of which he had been so proud should
have been depleted at one purchase.</p>

<p>As much chagrined as pitiful, he
watched his opportunity, and when
Grover Cleveland, who was “toting”
his packages from the store to the
wagon where his grandfather sat,
was gathering up his last armful he
called him to a rear window.</p>

<p>“Do you see that ar woman toilin’ up
the mountain with a poke on her back?”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s!” cried the child, “and
she’s got a little boy with her a heap
littler than me!”</p>

<p>“That woman’s yer Aunt Calliny;
and that ar little boy’s your own
cousin. Don’t you think one of them
caliker frocks ought to go to her and
some of that candy to little Jakey?
Why, he’s named for your gran’daddy.”</p>

<p>The loyal little grandson turned
away dispiritedly saying only:</p>

<p>“She done gran’daddy mean.”</p>

<p>“And that ar little feller’s shoes is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the raggedest you ever see,” this
last remark was flung after the boy
who was making a rapid exit.</p>

<p>The Ledbetter homestead was some
distance from the highroad behind
a screen of hills, and an old shed into
which the afternoon sun shone with
warm approval afforded privacy for
the trimming of the tree. Though
one pair of hands trembled with age
and one pair with eagerness, as early
as the twenty-second of December
it stood in glorious completeness. The
calico frocks, tightly rolled and tied
with twine, swung from the stoutest
branches, while the twigs bore fruit
of plug tobacco and candy in wasteful
and bewildering abundance.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five,”
counted the tired little
Santa Claus as he lay on his
bed that night. Three æons the
days seemed to him and he sighed
himself off to the land of Nod. The
old man too slipped smoothly off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to sleep, but he sighed as he went
to think that time flies so fast.
Dixie took no note of time, but before
morning he took note of a bear
that came nosing about the premises,
attracted by the smell of sweets,
and he barked so frantically as to
bring the old man upon the spot
armed with a musket that had seen
service in ’61. Bruin retired from
the scene with a leaden Christmas
gift under his hide and gran’daddy
wrapped himself in a tattered cloak
of army gray and patrolled till morning.
He felt hardly equal to two
more nights of keeping guard, so
he said to his grandson over their
early breakfast:</p>

<p>“This is a mighty pretty day and
it might rain a-Christmas.”</p>

<p>So they made out their itinerary
at once and, though they were subject
to some delays and gran’daddy
remarked as he groped for his gloves
in the wood box among dish towels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
frying pans, broken dishes, and
wearing apparel, “It’s quare what
a way things has of skulking out of
sight when they’re wanted,” and
the little boy replied as he tore a strip
from a window curtain and gartered
his stocking, “It’s ’cause we ain’t
got no woman here to keep ’em in
their place,” by sunrise the oxen were
hitched up and the premature Christmas
tree started on its journey.</p>

<p>It was a day of gentle, insinuative,
persistent sunshine, such as in these
mountains December is not chary
of. The frost-sheathed trees of the
highest ridges lay like a long fluff
of white ostrich feathers against
the azure; light snows and partial
thaws had converted the nearer
mountain sides into a darkly crayoned
network of lines and angles
upon a dappled ground; all around
them clustered the innumerable
beauties of the winter landscape, and
only the roads were vile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The old man looked a veritable Santa
Claus. Recognizing the churchly significance
of the occasion, he had unbraided
his beard and it fell before
him a rippling, silver shield; beneath
his gray slouch hat his kind eyes
twinkled in their coverts of shaggy
beetle-brows and, unconsciously completing
the picture, he had discarded
his tobacco for a corn-cob pipe.</p>

<p>Beside him, his little heart
a-flutter but his face held resolutely
serious, sat his grandson and between
them sat Dixie for, in recognition
of his services of the night,
he too had been advanced to the
position of a Santa Claus and in
a far corner of the wagon, where the
benefactor would not be tempted
to test for himself the comparative
blessedness of giving and receiving,
was a stack of bones (there
had been a “killing” the day before)
for Dixie to bestow upon his canine
acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>To old Mis’ Jimson the tree was
carried in pristine completeness.
From the well where she was trying
to persuade her cow that a handful
of meal in two gallons of water is
mush, she espied its green top coming
up behind the hill. For a moment
she watched it grow, but before
the oxen came into sight she hobbled
away in terror to her cabin.</p>

<p>“I knowed it,” she said. “I
knowed that ar owl a-hootin’ ’fore
the door all night, meant some kind
of meanness. ‘Trees as men
walkin’”—she paraphrased unwittingly,
and she didn’t know
whether the text was history or
prophecy. But she grabbed her
testament from off the shelf and a
rabbit’s foot from out the button
box, reassuring herself by a swift
glance that it was the left hind one
(no other “keeps a man from harm”),
pressed the two together, and ventured
to take another look. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
recognized the oxen, the wagon,
and its occupants. Her terror fled,
but she stood transfixed with amazement.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Jimson, this ’ere’s a sure
’nough Chrisamas tree,” called Grover
Cleveland.</p>

<p>She hobbled down to the gate.
“What upon airth, Jakey Ledbetter?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Her old neighbour’s answer was
an impressive silence while his unsteady
hands plucked from the tree
a roll of blue calico. “We reckoned,
Grover Cleveland and me did, that
this yer sprigged pattern would be
becomin’ to your build,” he said
presenting it.</p>

<p>“You ain’t tellin’ me that this
yer’s for me!”—she smoothed out
a fold with a quivering motion of
her rheumatic old hand—“Colonel
Ledbetter, I never <em>did</em> have a store
frock before and it’s more’n I ever
expected to own in this world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Moo-o,” complained the cow
and overturned the bucket, whereupon
an avalanche of “roughness”
descended upon her head.</p>

<p>“La me,” exclaimed Mis’ Jimson,
“is Christmas trees for the dumb
critters too?”</p>

<p>“That’s the view Grover Cleveland
’pears to take of it. Thar’s
enough for one fodderin’ gran’son;
we’ll drive round and put the rest
in the shed.”</p>

<p>Shielding her eyes with her hand
the old woman watched them out
of sight. “I ain’t been carin’
lately whether I was livin’ or not,”
she mused, “but if Christmas trees
is beginnin’ to circolate in these
yer mountings, I aim to perk up
and live long enough to git my
share.”</p>

<p>Most of the old people who were
young when gran’daddy was a boy
still occupied their fathers’ holdings
in clefts and coves up in the higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
mountains and to them the tree was
carried while the sunshine still
slanted and the roads were unthawed.
Time flies or I would tell of its
triumphant journey; how faded
eyes grew bright and wrinkles
wreathed themselves into smiles; how
salutations and jokes fresh fifty
years ago tripped upon the tongue as
nimbly as in their early days. Only
one failed to respond to the Christmas
spirit of the occasion. That
was old Captain Sumter. They
came upon him leaning over his
remnant of front fence viciously
fletcherizing tobacco of his own unskillful
curing.</p>

<p>“What fool consarn’s that, Jake
Ledbetter?” he growled as the turnout
stopped before him.</p>

<p>“It’s a Chrisamus tree,” called
Grover Cleveland, scrambling to the
ground and presenting him with
a package of choice Durham.</p>

<p>The old man pocketed it but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
thanks were of a fashion peculiarly
his own:</p>

<p>“Jake Ledbetter, you always was
the durndest fool in Junaluska.”</p>

<p>Only one took exception to her
gift. That was Aunt Sally Long,
the “queer old stick.”</p>

<p>“Now Jakey Ledbetter,” she
whined, “I can’t put that caliker to
no use in the world. I wove this
frock myself mighty nigh five year
ago”—she held out her narrow skirt
for his inspection—“and I ain’t
snagged it yet. I reckon it’s goin’
to last as long’s I do, at any rate I
don’t want another frock added unto
me. I’d a heap ruther you’d a
brung me a pound of snuff.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Sally” (the accommodating
Santa Claus took the roll from her
and restored it to the tree), “it’s my
intention for you to have whatever
you can get the most fun out of; I
can barter that thar frock for snuff
enough to last you all your life, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
there’ll be a balance comin’ to you
besides; what’ll you have for that?”</p>

<p>“I don’ know, Jakey,” she drawled,
and she pleated the hem of her
apron while she pondered, “I don’
know; I reckon you might as well
bring me a little more snuff.”</p>

<p>The roads were heavy with mud
when Bonaparte and Butterfly toiled
down into the little straggling town.
“This is a Chrisamus tree,” announced
the little Santa Claus, and
there was no need to tarry there for
delivery, for all the foot-free denizens,
young, old, and middle-aged,
thronged it when it stopped and
followed when it moved on, and
the tree shed its fruit as if a gale
had struck it.</p>

<p>The old Santa Claus held his
whip with a fine show of nonchalance
while the little one worked
among the holly branches, disdainful
of the thorns, his eyes afire, his
cheeks red hot, and his aureole of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
yellow hair tossing and tumbling
with every motion of his little body.
Williebelle, her ears tied up with
a red woollen stocking and redolent
of turpentine, was there and
upon her he bestowed three sticks
of peppermint, “two for herself and
one for her earache.” He waited in
person upon Aunt Polly, bedridden
for a dozen years, and the procession
was brought to a stand before her
door that she might look out upon
the first Christmas tree she had
ever seen.</p>

<p>“I ’low this is a Methdis’ Christmas
tree,” cried an Episcopalian
(the only cynical one), “you-all
aimed to get ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“No, siree,” answered the old
man, “this yer tree’s built according
to Grover Cleveland’s plan and he
don’t b’lieve in secks. We-all ain’t
aimin’ to git ahead of anybody but
the bears.”</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas,” shouted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
peace-making Episcopalian and the
crowd took up the greeting, “Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!” till
the hills gave back the echo.</p>

<p>The tired oxen drew the dismantled
tree out of the village.
The tired little Santa Claus
cuddled sleepily within the encircling
arm of the old one but they
left behind them the spirit of the
Christmas-tide. In the village
“Merry Christmas!” still sounded
from house to house and along the
streets. The sticky children shouted
it to one another; the women from
their door-ways told it to passers-by;
old men, nodding and smiling as
they fumbled with jack-knife and
tobacco and young men lounging
on the corners, all told it to one
another. Red Baptists told it to
Yellow Baptists and Presbyterians
to Methodists, and some unthinkingly
told it to persons they were
not on speaking terms with, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
looked ashamed but repeated it.
By and by the shadows came down
into the valley, crept to the summits
of the eastern ridge, slipped
over and the village lay in darkness
and in peace.</p>

<p>But high up on the mountain
side, in a lonely hut that had not
been visited by the Christmas tree,
Carolina cuddled her little boy to
sleep, crooning softly and sadly:</p>

<p class="no-indent fs80">
“While shepherds watched their flocks by night,<br>
All seated on the ground.”<br>
</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br>
<span class="fs80">CREEDS AND DEEDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Episcopalians met next
morning to trim the tree. They
had the candles and candies and
tinsel decorations sent them by the
foreign Santa Claus whom Grover
Cleveland had tried to track, and
for every member of their congregation
they had made little stockings
of net. These they proceeded to
fill with candy and to hang upon
the tree, discussing meanwhile the
perambulating tree of the previous
day.</p>

<p>“There was nary somebody passed
by,” said one, restoring with a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
of lemon stick the equilibrium of a
tilted stocking, “the babies got
something, every last one of ’em,
and the niggers too, so fur as I
know.”</p>

<p>“Every one was free to go to the
first Christmas celebration,” said
the young girl who taught the two-months-a-year
free-school. “The
shepherds came from the fields, and
the angels came from heaven, and
I have read that the wise men who
came were from so far removed
parts of the earth that they didn’t
even speak the same language.”</p>

<p>“You reckon they was all Episcopals?”</p>

<p>“No, but when they went away
they were all Christians.”</p>

<p>The rest of the decorators were
a little awed by such erudition and
no further remarks were made till
the last gift was tied in its place
and the candles, firmly fixed and
pointing rafterward, were ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
for the lighting. Then they stood
off and surveyed the work of
their hands.</p>

<p>“It’s powerful pretty,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, but seem like it’s narrow-contracted
’long side of Grover
Cleveland’s tree. ’Course we’ve got
six ten-cent dolls and he didn’t
have nary one and he didn’t have
nary candle but——”</p>

<p>“It’s not leavin’ out ary somebody
that I’m studyin’ about. Why
even our Nick got a shinbone, and
I declare if he ain’t fit Grover Cleveland’s
dog till he’s mighty nigh
chawed his ears plumb off his head.”</p>

<p>“Old man Higgins told me ‘Merry
Christmas’ yesterday evening. It’s
the first word he’s spoke to me
since I left the Methdis’ meetin’-house,
and I wish there was something
on this yer tree for him, just
to show him that we-all ain’t
holdin’ a grudge,” and further discussion
revealed the fact that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
one there had a neighbour or friend
belonging to one of the other churches
whom, for one reason or another,
he or she would like to invite to
the Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>The school teacher took a pencil
from her pocket and they gathered
round her. “We’ll begin at the
first house towards sun-up,” they
said; “there’s three somebodies
there, there’s two in the next house
and——” they counted every person
in the neighbourhood and then the
school teacher “done a sum.” “Nine
pounds more will treat them all to
candy,” she said and in a body
they proceeded to the store to see if
they could buy nine pounds at the
wholesale rate.</p>

<p>“I declare, ’tain’t my fault,”
pleaded the storekeeper. “I laid
in ten pounds extra for Christmas
but old man Ledbetter come in yer
and he let Grover Cleveland clean
me out. You can gen’rally, most always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
trust Colonel Ledbetter not
to do no low down tricks but you-all
know how’tis; if Grover Cleveland
was a-hankerin’ after the whole
top side of the airth his gran’daddy’d
git it for him if he could. I’ve
ordered some more, but it won’t be
here till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the school
teacher, “we’ll meet again this evening
to make some more stockings, and
we’ll trim the tree all over again and
we’ll have a Christmas tree for all
Junaluska.”</p>

<p>Some rustic beaux had been hanging
about the group listening to the
colloquy. They looked at one another
and they looked at a row of
fresh-faced, luxuriant-haired mountain
girls at another counter bartering
eggs which they had “toted” from
their homes five or six miles
away.</p>

<p>“Make it a general spree this
evening,” they pleaded, “let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
come to the tree-trimming and bring
our girls.”</p>

<p>“We will,” said the teacher, “if
you-all will spread the news that
it’s to be an un-de-nom-i-na-tional
tree and that all the grown-ups are
invited to come to-night to the
trimming and to bring for the tree
whatever gifts they have for their
families and their friends, and that
young and old are invited to the
exercises to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Captain Boyce won’t come nor
Judge Brevard, ary one; they took
a oath never to set foot in that
thar meetin’-house.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll move the tree somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>Such was the series of events
that transferred the tree and the
trimmers to Colonel Ledbetter’s two-room
cabin that overlooked the
village from a highroad. The log fire
blazing wide and high in the chimney
place put to shame the candles that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>swaled and sputtered in turnip candelabra,
but could not dim the light
that shone from merry eyes as the
happy people helped or hindered
with equally good intentions. Long
before dispersion could be thought
of the tree stood full fruited and
ready for the morrow’s harvesting.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">“They drew up some benches before the fire and gave
themselves to rest and reminiscence”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Suddenly the barking of a dog
roused the gully behind the cabin.</p>

<p>“That’s my Cæsar; he’s struck a
’possum trail,” exclaimed a swain
and with one rush young men and
maidens made for the moonlit out-of-doors
and joined in a ’possum
hunt. Only the serious minded remained,
fewer than a score of people
and yet they were the metaphorical
pillars of five different denominations
of Christian churches, each struggling
independently to establish the
same gospel in that little mountain
town. They drew up some benches
before the fire and gave themselves
to rest and reminiscence. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
road, in the fields, or at his fireside
the Junaluskan may address his
neighbour as Bill or Jeff or Jack, but
in assembly every elderly man is
accorded a title, military, civil, or
ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>“Gettin’ ’long in years, Colonel
Ledbetter,” observed a grizzled
mountaineer running his eyes along
the blackened rafters of the cabin;
“a hundred year old ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Mighty nigh,” answered the Colonel
shooting tobacco juice at a
fallen ember before kicking it back
into the fire.</p>

<p>“Looks like with a little fixin’ up
’twas good for another hundred.
You ain’t let it lately?”</p>

<p>“No, Deacon Higgins, I ain’t.”
The speaker doubled into his studying
attitude with unperceiving eyes
upon the hearth; “the last tenant
made a barnyard of the road out
yer in front, fed his cattle and
hogs there reg’lar so’t women folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
couldn’t git by to go to meetin’
without silin’ their Sunday clothes
and he let the ragweed run clean
up to the eaves. It hurt my feelin’s
to look at the place, ’twas such a
contrast to what ’twas when Preacher
Carr had it, so I turned him loose
and locked the door and I don’t
guess I’ll ever rent it again.”</p>

<p>“Preacher Carr certainly did keep
it mighty snug,” said Captain Campbell,
“and he was powerful proud
of it too. He’d point out to every
stranger the part the Injins built
and the part your father added on
to it; and he was proud of all outdoors
besides. He ’lowed there
wasn’t another tree in the country
so handsome to look at as this yer
postoak out in front.”</p>

<p>“And if he and his old gray mare
was on the homeward road any whar
near sundown, she’d break into a
trot of her own free will and accord,
knowin’ she’d got to git him here in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
time to see the sun slip down behind
the Bald.”</p>

<p>“And he done made a sermon
onct ’bout that ar cliff t’other side
the road. His tex’ was somethin’
’bout ‘The shadow of a Great Rock,’
and mighty nigh all the women in
the meetin’-house had to unfold
their pocket handkerchiefs ’fore he
got through.”</p>

<p>“And he done kep’ his tater-patch
as clean of weeds as my wife
keeps her posy beds.”</p>

<p>“And he worked jes’ as hard to
weed the sin out of Junaluska as he
did to weed the pusly and cockles
out of his roas’n’-ear patch.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” shouted Deacon Higgins.</p>

<p>“And he was always yer when he
was needed”—the voice was unsteady
and the speaker sat in the
shadow. “I tell ye it cuts me
powerful that when my wife died
last spring there was nary a preacher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to take her last test’mony, and she
a-askin’ for him all the time. The
neighbours done what they could
when we laid her away; they sung
a hymn and Judge Brevard read a
chapter, but there was nary a sermon
preached or a lesson of her life
said over her, and she a Meth’dis’
in good and reg’lar standin’. I
ain’t a-blamin’ our young preacher;
the branches was swelled at the fords
and the bridges was swept away.
He couldn’t git yer nohow. But
seem like something’s wrong when
we’ve got five meetin’-houses and
nary preacher living yer.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have Pres’terian preachin’
but once a month, because our
preacher’s got three other charges besides
Junaluska. He rides seventeen
miles to git yer; but he ain’t Samson
and he’s mighty nigh wore out ’fore
he begins, and he has to gallop through
the sarvice and ride off to after-dark
preachin’ somewheres else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Jes’ the same way ’tis with our
preacher”—the women were speaking
now—“he shakes hands friendly
like but I don’t guess, if all the folks
in the diff’rent places where he
preaches was stood up together,
he’d know me and my children from
the lot.”</p>

<p>“Them was good old times”—the
deacon’s wife took off her sunbonnet
and straightened up its
crown as she spoke—“when we
had one meetin’-house and preachin’
every Sunday and Preacher Carr
was right here on the ground ready
for marryin’ or buryin’ or any sich
like.”</p>

<p>“And Mis’ Carr—she was a
mother to all of us.”</p>

<p>“<em>Our</em> preacher’s got a right big
family and they do say that he don’t
make enough to keep ’em all comf’table;
but I don’t know how ’tis.
Our church agreed to give him
thirty dollars this year and we done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
raised fo’teen of it cash down
and we reckoned we’d about make
up the balance of it in apples and
potatoes; there was some corn give
besides. To be sure there was no
way for him to haul it home, for
he don’t own a wagon; but seem
like, if his other churches done as
well by him as we do, he wouldn’t
be so peaked looking. They say
he ain’t nary top coat to wear, but
we-all give him nine pair of mittens
and five pair of wristers, and
Callerstown give him seven pair of
mittens and four comforters for his
neck and some wristers besides, and
it do seem like his other churches
ought to give him a overcoat.”</p>

<p>A few minutes of thoughtful
silence ensued; then a philosopher
spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s a heap easier to ’stablish
churches than ’tis to support ’em
after they’re sot goin’.”</p>

<p>With a deeply drawn breath Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Ledbetter stretched out his
legs, set his soles upright before the
fire, folded his arms and squared
himself. He waited respectfully for
the old bench to complete its squeaking
preface, then, singling out one
fork of a blazing log, addressed it
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland, he don’t believe
in beliefs and I’ve been
a-studyin’ whether he ain’t right.
I reason this a-way:</p>

<p>“You-all know how ’tis with the
gris’-mills round yer; some of ’em
is run by a turbine wheel and some
by a overshot wheel and Captain
Campbell he’s jes’ sot up a undershot
wheel. But if the day of meracles
wasn’t past and some of us should
stop on our way home from the mill
and leave ole Mis’ Jimson a bag of
meal, it would keep her and her ole
cow from starvin’ plumb to death
and she’d never ask which mill
ground that ar grist. And in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
opinion that’s the way ’tis with
these yer diff’rent religious secks
we’ve got in Junaluska; they each
turn their crank in their own way
but there ain’t much choice in the
grist they turn out; that is to say,
neighbours, if you judge a man from
his outgoin’s and his incomin’s it
would take more than human jedgment
to tell whether he’s been ground
by the Piscopals or the Methdises or
the Presaterians or the Baptises.</p>

<p>“When we git riled, Presaterian
cussin’ don’t sound noways diff’rent
from Methdis’ cussin’ and a wayfarin’
man in Junaluska could never
tell by lookin’ at the children’s
frocks and faces whether their
mothers believe that sprinklin’ or
duckin’ is the tellin’est means of
grace; and Baptis’ hogs and cattle
left out on the mountings all winter
without fodder and shelter looks
jes’ as gaunted-up when spring
comes as the Piscopals’ does. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
beginnin’ to think, neighbours, that
there’s right much more religion in
<em>doin’</em> then there is in fussin’ about
beliefs.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” shouted a Methodist
brother and the speaker gained
courage.</p>

<p>“I’d like,” he went on, “to jine
hands and pull together again, and
don’t meddle with each others’ beliefs,
till some one’s deeds shows
that his creed is the best. I’d like
not to worship any longer in meetin’-houses
that ain’t as snug as a barn
ought to be. All of us together
can keep one building painted and
the roof tight and the windows
sashed. I’d like not to have a
hand in starvin’ or freezin’ any more
preachers, but to make one preacher
comf’table right here in Junaluska—we
done it once and we done
it without any outside help too—and
we can do it ag’in. I’d like
to have him always right yer on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the ground to christen our children,
to bury our dead, and to marry our
young folks. For myself, I ain’t
carin’ what college turned him out
so’s he’s a sure-’nough Christian
and cares more about right livin’
than he does about beliefs.”</p>

<p>By the wall, the only occupant
of a bench with legs of assorted
lengths and easily tilted, sat Deacon
Higgins who here put in a demurrer.
Jolting back and forth, bringing
the bench legs and his feet resoundingly
upon the floor to mark his time,
he sang, his eyes fixed upon a rafter
and his heart upon opposition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I’m Meth’dis born an Pres’terian bred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But Meth’dis will I die!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I’m a shoutin’ Meth’dis.”</p>

<p>“Well, you could continue on a
shouting Meth’dis!”</p>

<p>“La, yes;” Colonel Ledbetter’s
plan had won some enthusiastic
supporters among the women.
“Deacon Higgins you could take an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
amen corner for you and your folks
and we-all wouldn’t object to your
shoutin’ in once in a while.”</p>

<p>“And if the Piscopals wants to
stand up and stretch their legs and
try a readin’ match with the
preacher now and then, why we
could accommodate ’em with some
Bible-readin’ ‘long with the singin’
and preachin’; the Bible makes
good readin’ for any ’casion.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired,” said a weary-eyed
woman. “I’m tired of the everlastin’
scratchin’ round to git ahead
of some one else; I’m tired of runnin’
our church with one eye onto four
other churches to see that they
don’t come out a step ahead.”</p>

<p>Here a horse’s hoofs clattered
upon the frozen road in front. Two
or three women went to the window.
“It’s Preacher Freeman,” they
announced. “He’s on his way to
Mills’s Ford to see that man that’s
been hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“He’s got nine miles further to
ride and it’s mighty cold.”</p>

<p>The door opened and a tall man,
dark and spare, entered. He might
have been thirty years old, but he
smiled at the tree with boyish appreciation
as he made his way past
it and gave the assembly a general
“Howdy.” Then he drew off his
mittens and went from one to another
shaking hands though he didn’t
call them all by name. His own church
people were there, but it is needless
to name their denominational conformity—he
was an honour to any
church. They gave him a seat before
the fire and he stretched out his
shabbily shod feet toward it with
a tired sigh, but an involuntary one,
for he checked it.</p>

<p>“I stopped at your house Judge
Brevard,” he said, “and learned that
you were here.”</p>

<p>Embarrassed at being found in
company so ecclesiastically mixed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Brevard irrelevantly felt of the
young man’s coat.</p>

<p>“Tollable thin for this weather,”
he said.</p>

<p>“The exercise of riding keeps me
warm,” answered the preacher and
changed the subject. “I didn’t expect
to find all my people here” (with kind
eyes he seemed to single out his own).
“I’m <em>glad</em> of it,” he continued heartily.
“I’m <em>glad</em> to see the whole
neighbourhood joining hands.”</p>

<p>He praised the tree, gave a few
minutes to general and friendly discourse,
arranged with Brevard the
personal matter which had been the
object of his call, wished them a
“Merry Christmas” and went out.
They heard him speak to his horse
as he untied him but in a moment
he entered the cabin again. He
came forward haltingly and laid
a hand upon the back of a bench,
fidgeting like an embarrassed schoolboy
as he began to speak:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Brethren, I spent last night
twenty miles from here up on the
Harriman Mountain. You-all know
what Harriman is like.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ledbetter twisted himself
round and faced the speaker.</p>

<p>“It’s the barrenest, ungratefulest
land in the North Callina Mountains”
(his voice had a defiant twang
as if he challenged contradiction),
“and how old Preacher Carr wrastles
a livin’ out of that place he’s settled
on, is more’n I can study out.”</p>

<p>“It’s Preacher Carr I want to
speak to you about. You-all know
that Brother Carr can get a crop
out of a piece of ground if any one
can. Next to men’s souls he loves
the soil, and, my friends, whether
we work with things physical or
spiritual, it’s the loving touch that
coaxes on the harvest. You-all
know that, with late spring frosts
and summer droughts, this has been
a hard year for our farmers—your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
own cribs are only half full of corn
and your fodder stacks are few and
small; and yet your valley is a
Land of Promise compared to Harriman’s
Bald. Preacher Carr and his
wife are facing a winter of want.
They gave me the mountaineer’s
welcome, but when she prepared
the supper, I heard her gourd-scoop
scrape the bottom of the meal
bin, and this morning a creditor
led away their staggering, starving
cow. And yet Brother Carr is not
decrepit; he is still hale and hearty
but—God pity the old when their
work is taken out of their hands
before their graves are ready for
them.</p>

<p>“He asked after his people in
Junaluska (you will be ‘<em>his</em> people’
as long as his loyal old soul harbours
a sentiment) and, when I
told him I should pass through here
this evening, he said, ‘Tell them a
God-bless you, for me.’ Some one has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
told him that his old church is well-nigh
gone to ruin and he asked me
to take notice of it as I passed by
and to shut the door if it stood open.</p>

<p>“So I have come back to ask
you to add to your Christmas list
the name of your old neighbour,
friend, and pastor, this needy servant
of God. He has not forgotten
you and I know you will not
forget him.”</p>

<p>He turned and walked out of the
cabin and the group sat in silence
till the sound of his horse’s hoofs
grew faint.</p>

<p>“Them was good old times,”
reiterated the deacon’s wife.</p>

<p>“I was some to blame when
Preacher Carr was sent away,” said
Colonel Ledbetter, “I own up to
it but——”</p>

<p>“You hadn’t a mite more to
say about it than the rest of us
had——”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t a thing in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
agin him,” the old man went on
without noticing the interruption;
“’twas only that two other churches
was a-runnin’ opposition to us and
their preachers were young men
and were drawing off our young
people; I thought if we had a young
man to preach for us we might get
’em all back again. ’Twas zeal that
made me do it, misguided zeal;
you see I hadn’t studied it out about
religious secks then as I have since.”</p>

<p>But we need not give a full report
of that meeting. It was not conducted
by parliamentary rules, but
its enactments went into effect
next day.</p>

<p>Grover Cleveland and gran’daddy,
side by side in the old farm wagon,
took the road while it was still so
dark that they must needs give
the mules the rein. But there were
other early risers in that community,
for by sunrise Campbell and Greenlee
and Brevard and others were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
playing away with hammer and
trowel upon the Ledbetter cabin.
They repaired the roof, they cemented
into place the loose stones of
the fireplace, and topped out the
fallen chimney; between the logs
they spatted clay—taken from the
road in front but good as imperial
Cæsar’s—and stopped the cracks
“to keep the wind away.” They
propped the leaning cow shed and
before noon an occupant, “mighty
nigh all Jersey,” was chewing her
cud, while over her head was stored
fodder sufficient to keep her chewing
till pastures were green. Her
neighbour on the other side of a partition
was a Kentucky-bred roan
mare, which but a few hours ago
had been the property of Captain
Campbell; he had appeared upon the
scene riding a gray and leading the
roan all saddled and ready for the
road and had made her comfortable
in this new home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>In durance a heterogeneous collection
of chickens were making one
another’s acquaintance over a collation
of corn, the only unsociable
one among them being Aunt Dicey’s
old black hen; her powers were all
employed in an effort to rid herself
of a streamer of red flannel which
the old lady had tied to her tail to
discourage her sitting propensities.</p>

<p>Within doors the Christmas tree
with its unshed mask still monopolized
one room, but in the other
cheerful hands worked a metamorphosis.
Cobwebs, litter, and soil
disappeared, and furniture, country
made but adapted to its purpose,
took its place. Upon the tough
and rough old chestnut floor they
levelled a bed of hay and, so that
it was soft as pillows to the tread,
what matter that each breadth of
the rag carpet they spread upon it
showed different tones of homemade
dyes and the weave of a different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
loom? In one corner they
corded together a bedstead in the
good old fashion of their great-grandparents,
and the bed they reared
upon it was a marvel. There was
a mattress of oat straw and one of
corn-husks, a bed of stripped hens’
feathers and one of geese feathers,
and bolsters and pillows in numbers
sufficient to accommodate a family
of hydras. Aunt Dicey furnished
blankets spun and woven by her own
hands from wool of her own shearing,
and among a collection of quilts
was a wonderful one of old Mis’
Jimson’s piecing. It contained, by
actual count, three thousand one
hundred and seventy-nine pieces and
she called it “The Foundation of
the Great Deep.” When at last
that bed was made up, the turkey
red cherubs on the pillow-shams
(almost the only shams that modernity
had introduced among those
artless people) lay very close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rafters. Its makers viewed it with
admiration and complacency, but
Deacon Higgins looked dubious:</p>

<p>“They’re a tollable spry old
couple,” he said, “but”—and he
wheeled a barrel of potatoes alongside
as a suggestion of means of
getting into bed.</p>

<p>It would take a readier pen than
mine to enumerate and describe
all the gifts that were brought to
that plenishing. The cupboard door
refused to close upon the array
of ham, hominy, and honey (the
three h’s of the mountaineer), the
salt-rising bread, and the soda
biscuit.</p>

<p>Major Greenlee was a carpenter.
For half a day he planed, sawed,
and hammered in a corner and when
his work took form it was a capacious
meal bin. When bagfuls of corn
meal had been emptied into it till
it was “plumb full” they all surveyed
it with satisfaction and “reckoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the gourd wouldn’t scrape the
bottom of that before spring.”</p>

<p>All day long pedestrians and
vehicles had been coming and going
before the old house as never before
in its history and yet when the sun
had set the sky on fire behind the
Bald, the gathered people were still
awaiting an arrival.</p>

<p>They scanned a mountain road
above them, visible only in short
lengths where it emerged from the
forests into the clearings.</p>

<p>“I see ’em!” a far-sighted old
man shouted with a boy’s enthusiasm,
“I see Colonel Ledbetter’s white
mules! Now they’re behind May’s
Peak, you’ll see ’em come out on
t’other side.”</p>

<p>And so they watched them from
point to point and every time they
came into view a squad ran in to
re-inspect the cabin and see that
every thing was in order.</p>

<p>At last the white mules stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
before the door. Colonel Ledbetter
and Grover Cleveland sat on the
front seat of the wagon, and on
chairs behind them sat Preacher
Carr and his wife.</p>

<p>Strong hands assisted the wife to
alight, but the preacher sprang over
the wheel to greet his people. They
crowded round him and the young
cried, “Merry Christmas,” and the
old said, “Welcome Home.”</p>

<p>They seated the pair beside their
old beloved fireside. They were
eight years older than when they
had left it. The preacher had “held
his own,” but when they took off
the good wife’s bonnet her hair
showed very white. A tender hand
smoothed it.</p>

<p>“We are growing old,” said the
preacher, but they told him that
the gospel that he preached and
lived would never grow old. They
told him too of repairs to be made
in the old church; it would look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
just as it used to look but over the
door there would be the inscription:</p>


<p class="center no-indent fs80">THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart and with all thy soul and with all
thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
</div>

<p>The tree was stripped; the white
mules were headed homeward; old
man Ledbetter gathered up his reins
and a tired little lad nestled close
to his side.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Grover Cleveland,
wake up! Don’t you hear ’em
singing! Jine in, Grover Cleveland,
jine in!”</p>

<p>Within the cabin a chorus swelled;
without, one thin little voice piped
free and clear:</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs80">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Crown Him, crown Him, crown Him, Lord of all.”</div>

<span class="fs80">UNCONSCIOUS MENTALITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>What their acquaintances called
an “understanding,” existed between
Arsula Jordan and Thaddeus Garrett
and he had taken her with him
up on the mountain to consult Dan
Cutter about hauling the timber
for a new house. Their horse,
Beauregard, having taken the road
leisurely, eleven o’clock found them
winding along the downhill road but
still two miles from their homes
in the village.</p>

<p>On their right the Junaluska
swirled between its wooded banks.
The moon was on their right too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
throwing shadows across their road,
dense or skeleton, as evergreen or
deciduous trees obstructed its
radiance.</p>

<p>“I think I see things a-skulkin’
’cross the road,” said Arsula, crowding
Thad more closely; “do you
reckon any wild-cats could have
come down off the Bald?”</p>

<p>“It’s only the shadders a-shiftin’
theirselves when the wind bends
the trees; I didn’t reckon you was
that scary, Suly; why there’s nothin’
to be scairt of; <em>I’m</em> here Suly! And
<em>I</em> ain’t scairt of anything that travels
these yer mountings—leastwise not
of anything in flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>“Well I ain’t scart of anything
that <em>isn’t</em> flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>“<em>You say you ain’t?</em>”</p>

<p>“La, no; I don’t b’lieve in
ha’nts.”</p>

<p>“<em>You say you don’t?</em>”</p>

<p>“No I don’t; I b’lieve that when
a body’s once plumb dead and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
buried in the ground, he ain’t goin’
to show hisself on the top side of
the earth again till judgment day.</p>

<p>“Oh lawdy!” the ejaculation was
only aspirated, and Thad brought
Beauregard to a stand without speaking
to him. They were at a bend of
the road where it crossed the river.
Above the ford, dark hemlocks
arched the stream and the foot log
lay in their dense shadow. Upon
it something moved like a pale gray
cloud, not outlined against the blackness,
but softly blending with it.</p>

<p>Beauregard saw it too and pricked
up his ears. Thad wound the reins
round his right hand and even
brought his left into action though
with a soft apology to Suly:</p>

<p>“Looks like I might want all the
hands I’ve got to hold him. You
take a tight holt of me,” he counselled
under his breath and, as the
spectre neared the farther side, proceeded
chidingly: “It’s powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
triflin’, Suly, to go to talkin’ ’bout
ha’nts when you’re out in the woods
at night—it’s tollable sure to call
’em up”—a rustling among the
dry leaves under the bushes changed
the course of his remarks.</p>

<p>“If the durn thing ’ud move a
little faster, I’d drive into the water
and stand a spell; witches and
ha’nts and all them things is shy
of water.” There was a closer
scurry among the leaves and at a
twitch of the reins Beauregard drew
them into the ford and stopped
there in obedience to another silent
signal.</p>

<p>Above the rustling they heard
a panting breath, and another ghost,
a nimbler one, was on the log, a
light, flying shadow against the dark,
stationary ones.</p>

<p>“Sho,” said Suly, “it’s only a
dog.” She started to whistle but
Thad clapped his hand over her
mouth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“For gracious sake, Suly, don’t
do that—it’s awful darin’.”</p>

<p>She was gurgling and spurting
in an effort to regain her right
of free speech when together the
apparitions seemed to slip off the
log upon the other side.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s Colonel Ledbetter’s
Dixie,” she cried as a dog frisked
out into the moonlight; “and sure’s
you’re born that’s little Grover
Cleveland! and he’s walkin’ in his
sleep again—poor little soul! Git
up Beau!” She clutched at the
reins, but Thad caught her hand.</p>

<p>“Poor little soul!” she repeated.
“His gran’daddy’d go plumb distracted
if he knowed that little
soul was out on the mountings this
time o’ night; nothin’ on him either,
I reckon, but just his little shirt!
Thad, if you don’t drive on right
now, I’ll jump into the crick, I vow
I will! I want to get my hands on
him—poor little soul!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>When Beauregard trailed out upon
the other side Suly leaped to
the ground. “I want to see how
he looks when he’s took this-a-way.”</p>

<p>The boy was several rods ahead
trudging abstractedly along, his
little, faded, blue-checked shirt
playing about his knees, his bare
feet taking the road unhesitatingly,
his half-closed eyes looking neither
right nor left nor seemingly before
him. Curious, pitiful, Arsula
walked beside him for a few steps
in silence. He didn’t hear her nor
the creak of the wagon behind her.
His physical senses were in suspension.
He was intently acting
out some dream that dominated
his little brain.</p>

<p>Head and tail adroop, Dixie was
following so closely that now and
again his muzzle touched the little
loosely hanging hand. He seemed
to take no more notice of Arsula as
she came abreast than did his child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
master; but <em>he</em> was not walking in
his sleep, for, though his dejected
head never swerved, his eyes turned
sidewise in their sockets and his lips
wrinkled in very unbecoming folds
above his teeth.</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland,” Suly spoke
softly, for, despite her brave common
sense, she felt awed in this
presence of a ruling, supernatural
mentality; besides she wanted to
spare the little favourite the shock
of a too sudden awakening. But
the boy walked on.</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland, oh, Grover
Cleveland!” she said more emphatically
and gently put out her
hand to take him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Gr-r-r-r-r-r!” said Dixie.</p>

<p>“Now look here Dixie Ledbetter,”
she scolded severely, “you needn’t
go to putting on any such airs as
that when I’m around. I wouldn’t
do Grover Cleveland mean a mite
sooner’n you would, and you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
it. And more than that, if I’d
been in your place I’d have found
some way to wake him up before
he’d tramped this far in the cold.
And more than that, t’other side
the ford you went tearin’ off after
a rabbit or a ’possum or a coon,
and left him to find his way all by
hisself. Now you get over there
and don’t you say no more to <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>Ashamed of his shortcomings or
awed by her gestures, which were
imperious, Dixie slunk to the other
side of his master who, partially
recovered by the unusual tones,
came to a stand dazed and
trembling.</p>

<p>“Poor little soul!” she said dropping
to her knees and putting her
arms about him. “Wake up, dear,
and don’t you be scairt a mite, for
it’s only Suly; you know Suly,
don’t you?” her voice broke and a
tear or two ran over her cheeks.</p>

<p>The child, coming slowly back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
consciousness, gazed blankly into
her face, then turned and peered
into the woods, drawing his breath
in hard, dry sobs. Then he recognized
Dixie and felt of his tattered
ears with a weakly caressing motion.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dixie’s here,” coaxed Suly,
“and I’m here and Thad’s here with
the wagon and we’re goin’ to carry
you right home to your gran’daddy.”</p>

<p>By now Thaddeus was beside
them. “Well, what about it!” was
all he could say, but he acted
promptly upon Suly’s bidding and
lifted the boy into the wagon.</p>

<p>Suly wrapped him in a time-worn
blanket of confederate gray that had
been doing duty as a cushion and
set him between them.</p>

<p>“Now where was you a-goin’ to?”
interrogated the amazed Thaddeus,
taking up the reins and driving
slowly on.</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” sobbed the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Why he was going home,” kindly
assisted Suly.</p>

<p>“Where have you been at?” persisted
Thaddeus.</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know.”</p>

<p>“Well how’d you <em>git</em> here, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Now Thad, you quit pesterin’
him,” commanded Suly.</p>

<p>By now the boy was quite himself
and making desperate efforts
to breathe without sobbing. “It’s
powerful mizzable to be borned with
ways that you can’t help,” he faltered,
and the girl essayed to change
the current of his thoughts.</p>

<p>“You knowed your Aunt Carliny
and little Jakey had come back
here to live, didn’t you, Grover
Cleveland?”</p>

<p>“She done gran’daddy mean,”
answered the boy and added after
a long, tremulous breath, “Jakey’s
shoes is wore out.”</p>

<p>They drove on in silence. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the boy had become quiet and too
sleepy, Arsula believed, to take
notice of what she was saying, she
ventured to relieve her mind of some
of its distracting emotions.</p>

<p>“If Carliny was where she’d
ought to be, a-keepin’ house for her
father, this little soul’d never get
out of the house at night without
her knowin’ it—I’m plumb sure
of that. To think of her livin’
away off up there in that gully where
nary somebody passes, month in
and month out, in a ole hut with
nothin’ but a dirt floor and no
window; and chinks between the
logs that you can put your hand
into and her father the best-off man
round yer! What you reckon
he’d say if they was found froze
plumb to death? And he such a
powerful pious man and a-standin’
way up high in the church! Free-handed
too—where he takes a notion—givin’
the preacher his rent free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and all the wood he’s a mind to cut
and haul and all the apples and
corn and potatoes he’s a mind to
harvest; and a-pilin’ up fodder
stacks close to ole Mis’ Jimson’s
fence and a-pullin’ out a rail with
his own hands so’s her ole cow can
get her head through and help
herself.</p>

<p>“Carliny told me with her own
lips that after she and her boy had
come all the way from Yancey
County—mighty nigh every step
afoot too—her father wouldn’t let
her in. She wouldn’t have come—for
she’s got along tollable since
she’s been a widow—only but she
heard that he and Grover Cleveland
wasn’t doin’ any good a housekeepin’
by theirselves; and it hurt
her powerful to think that her
sister Missouri’s little boy wasn’t
gettin’ the right kind of care.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s clean done out
about it. The preacher, he set out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to labour with him, but Colonel
Ledbetter he give him to understand
that he was oversteppin’ his authority
and since then nary neighbour
darst speak up. But I’d give a
pretty to tell Colonel Ledbetter
what <em>I</em> think of him, and I aim to
do it this very night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, Suly; ole man Ledbetter
ain’t pleasant to talk to
when he’s riled.”</p>

<p>There came the sound of some one
tearing through the woods, and
Thad brought Beauregard to a sudden
stand. “Here we are,” he
shouted.</p>

<p>“You-all got him!” called a quavering
voice out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Got him sure-’nough, Colonel
Ledbetter. Captured him way off
down by the ford!”</p>

<p>“I been trampin’ the woods for
a hour lookin’ for him and I’m
hoarse as a crow callin’ for him.
Is he dressed up much?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Not much. Some durn fools
would have took him for a ha’nt
but I don’t never run from nothin’
and Suly here, she’s some spunky too.”</p>

<p>They drove slowly to the house
the old man keeping abreast. The
door stood open and from within
shone the light of a flickering
hearth fire.</p>

<p>Grover Cleveland shed his blanket,
sprang over the wheel while it was
yet in motion, and fled into the house
and out of sight.</p>

<p>The old man chuckled. “The
little feller’s right much ashamed of
hisself when he’s found out in one
of his spells. I reckon he cried
some when you-all woke him up—he
gen’ally does.</p>

<p>“Them that’s had nothin’ to cry
for’s the ones that’s done the cryin’,”
teased Thad.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I did,” said Suly
preparing to accept the invitation
to “stop in by a spell.” “It must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
be a mighty nasty feelin’ to wake
up in the woods at night and not
know how you got there.”</p>

<p>“So it is, so it is,” said Colonel
Ledbetter leading the way into the
house. “I ain’t no mind to be stern
with him, for he comes true and
honest by the trick. I done it
myself when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>He replenished the fire and lit
a candle.</p>

<p>“He sleeps right there betwixt
me and the wall,” he pointed to a
bed in the corner, “and I can’t
contrive how he manages to give
me the slip so often; he’s got some
sort of sleepin’ slyness that he ain’t
no more notion of when he’s awake,
than a angel. Barricadin’ the door
ain’t no good. One night I tied
him fast to my wrist so’s he couldn’t
move without wakin’ me up, but
that seemed to hurt the little fellow’s
feelin’s powerful an’ I didn’t
try it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen of Grover
Cleveland. Suly went to the bed.</p>

<p>“I should think he’d smother to
death,” she said, “he’s drawed the
Valley of the Mississippi clean over
his head and he’s fast asleep.” She
arranged a little breathing place
for him.</p>

<p>The old man came and stood
beside her.</p>

<p>“I helped quilt this quilt,” she
went on, carefully folding it away
from the face of the child, “it
was the first quiltin’ party I ever
went to and I took the tuck out of
my frock to go. This was the first
Valley of the Mississippi ever seen
round yer and Missouri was mighty
proud of it; she had the pattern
sent from Georgy.”</p>

<p>“Them blue pieces over there,”
said the old man, “is pieces of her
frock; it was a store frock; and these
yer streaked pieces on this side” (he
traced them with an unsteady finger),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
“was my wife’s. Grover Cleveland,
he calls that side his, because
it’s pieces of his mother’s frock, and
this side mine and he won’t never
get into bed till his half’s on his
side.”</p>

<p>Suly lifted a corner of the quilt
into the light; “Here’s some of
Carliny’s frock,” she led, but he
would not follow.</p>

<p>“I bought Grover Cleveland a
pair of boots this mornin’ and he
was the proudest little somebody
you ever looked at. Now where is
them boots at?”—he was looking
under the bed—“he set ’em up
right here as careful as if they was
glass and they was there after he
went to sleep.”</p>

<p>This owner in fee-simple of eleven
hundred acres of land, more or less,
was living in one room and dishes,
cooking utensils, clothing, shovels,
rakes and various paraphernalia of
his farming and housekeeping operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
were littered about in bewildering
confusion. He moved
everything in his search for the
boots, Arsula assisting.</p>

<p>“Carliny’s a mighty good housekeeper,”
she remarked as she shook
out and hung up some wearing
apparel that had been piled in a
corner. “She’d make things look
a heap different if she was here.”</p>

<p>“Was he barefoot when you come
acrost him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Carliny, she’d manage it
so that poor little soul wouldn’t
go caperin’ about at night.”</p>

<p>“Them boots has taken to theirselves
wings.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Carliny’s goin’ to
freeze to death up there this winter—or
starve—one.”</p>

<p>“Them boots had blue tops; they
was Grover Cleveland’s own choice;
blue always takes his eye.”</p>

<p>“It’s time we was movin’ on,
Suly,” said Thad going to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>The girl had to stop beating the
bush. “Carliny and Jakey ain’t
a-doin’ any good up there, Colonel
Ledbetter; they’re both a-lookin’
puny. She wants you and you want
her, and Grover Cleveland, he wants
her powerful, poor little soul!
’Tain’t right, nor Christian, nor
human, nor common sense, nor horse
sense, nor nonsense, nor any kind
of sense for you to be so set. She’s
your own flesh”—she stopped, awed
by his steady stare at her.</p>

<p>“You go home,” he said, “and
you sew the tuck back into that ar
frock you wore to Missouri’s quiltin’
and you wear it and be a little gal
again till you’re smart enough not
to handle no such talk as that in
my house. Carliny, she made her
own bed and thar she must lie. I
told her when she married that ar
no-’count that she shouldn’t never
put foot into house of mine again;
and you go ask your daddy if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
ever knowed a Ledbetter to go back
on his word. And I’m bringin’ up
Grover Cleveland the same way;
he believes like I do; he thinks
Carliny’d ought to go her own
gait now.”</p>

<p>Arsula went out of the house with
her hand to her eyes.</p>

<p>“I ’low you mean right,” he said
softening a little, “and I’m a heap
o’ times obliged to you for bringin’
him home, but you ain’t no call to
go to interferin’ in <em>my</em> family affairs.”</p>

<p>All the next day Grover Cleveland
hunted for his boots. “I sot ’em
right here,” he said, “and I ain’t
touched ’em since.” In the house
he had turned every thing over and
over again, had gone through the
barn and out-houses in the same way
and at sundown was searching the
woods when Arsula a-mule-back rode
up to the house. Colonel Ledbetter
was chopping wood but he
put down his axe and went to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve come from Carliny’s,” she
said, “and here’s them blue-top
boots. Carliny found ’em outside
her door this morning and she’d no
more notion than the dead whose
they was or how they got there,
till I told her ’bout last night.”</p>

<p>The old man turned them in
his hands confusedly. “If Grover
Cleveland took these boots up thar
last night,” he said, “his sleepin’
opinion is a heap different from his
wakin’ opinion. When he’s awake
he ’grees with me; he thinks if she
was so set on goin’ her own gait,
now she’d ought to keep on
goin it.”</p>

<p>Arsula rode off and he went into
the house and tucked the boots out
of sight.</p>

<p>By the by his grandson came in
dispirited and weary, ate a little
supper, and crept away under his
side of the Valley of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“He ain’t eatin’ as much as he’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
ought to,” mused his grandfather
as he scraped the remnant of their
meal upon the hearth for Dixie.
“If Missouri was alive she’d make
somethin’ to tempt his appetite,
but I ’low I ain’t got the sleight
o’ cookin’.” He went to the bed
and tucked the quilt closely about
the child’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“He’ll lay quiet enough to-night;
I never knowed him to get up two
nights runnin’. Seem like he gets
scairt and keeps still a spell. I’m
mighty nigh beat out myself, bein’
up so late yesterday evenin’; I
reckon I can sleep without any
rockin’,” and he went to bed.</p>

<p>He awoke after a three-hours’
nap. The room was cold and his
first thought was to see if the Valley
of the Mississippi was doing its duty
by his grandson. It was not; and
when he attempted to pull it into
place he found there was no grandson
there; neither did there appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
to be a complement of the Valley
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland! Grover Cleveland!”
he shouted and the only
answer was a stampede of rats
from the hearth. He got up,
lighted his candle, and held it low
over the bed. The boy was surely
gone. He pulled the quilt toward
him and as he did so the big old shears
that served them in their various
household operations fell to the
floor. The quilt had been cut
through from end to end; the side
containing the striped pieces had
been left in its place but the blue
had disappeared!</p>

<p>He got into his clothes and hurrying
out among the shadows of the
moonlight night took his direction
with the certainty of prescience.
When he set foot upon the highroad,
he began to follow by sight, for,
excepting where the shadows were
heaviest, he could discern the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
trudging figure of Grover Cleveland,
its outline marred by something slung
in man-like fashion across his shoulder
and by the dog following closely.</p>

<p>He didn’t try to overtake the
child, but, though the road was
crooked, he never let him get out of
his sight for a second. Sometimes
in dark, rough places the man stumbled.
“Seem like some spirit’s
a-guidin’ the boy,” he said. “He
don’t ’pear to make a false step”;
and, like Suly, he was awed.</p>

<p>As they neared the ford he lessened
the distance between them
but, though his heart stood still
when the boy got upon the foot log
(for the stream was running high)
he made no sign but to take off his
coat ready for a plunge if emergency
called for it.</p>

<p>They crossed in close procession,
the little sleeper, the dog, and the
old man. Upon the other side the
leader kept the highroad for a furlong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
or more and then, where a
rough culvert conducted a small
branch into the Junaluska, turned
into a rocky gully and ascended by
a rough, steep path, the others following.
Two or three times Dixie,
turning to the old man, entreated with
tail and eyes for an explanation of
these strange proceedings, but by pantomime
was ordered into line again.</p>

<p>Upward and onward they went,
no sound accompanying but the
tramp of their feet, the rustle of
leaves as some frightened animal
darted from its lair, the gurgle of
the brook, and the recoil of the
low-hanging branches which two of
them nimbly dodged, but the old
man put aside with his hands.</p>

<p>At last they came out upon a
table of shale, dry and white in the
moonlight. On its edge, backed by
a cliff, stood a forlorn cabin, built
for a stable one might have thought,
but for the pile of clay and stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
that showed at which end of it a
chimney had once stood.</p>

<p>Straight up to its sagging door
marched the little sleeper, laid the
blue-blocked half of the Valley of
the Mississippi upon the rotten step,
and then—the silent procession
“marched down again.”</p>

<p>Next morning the sun was shining
through the open doorway and Colonel
Ledbetter with an awl and a
waxed-end was splicing a strap when
Grover Cleveland sat up in bed
and rubbed his eyes open with his
fists. Suddenly he shouted:</p>

<p>“Gran’daddy! gran’daddy! here’s
the Valley of the Mississippi cut
plumb in half and your part’s here
and”—he wriggled to the floor
and grabbed his gran’daddy by the
shoulder—“where’s my half gone
to, gran’daddy?” Without waiting
for an answer the child went
back to the bed and made a more
thorough examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Gran’daddy! gran’daddy! don’t
you reckon ’twas a mighty low-down
somebody to do that trick?”</p>

<p>“I ’low ’twas, Grover Cleveland—that
is, if he knowed what he
was doin’, ’twas.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes grew bigger and
bigger.</p>

<p>“Maybe you been a-performin’
in your sleep again, Grover Cleveland.”</p>

<p>“No I ain’t gran’daddy, no I
ain’t,” the blue eyes were very
earnest. “I done been in bed close
up to you all night.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you have, Grover Cleveland,
but ’pears like you overslept
yourself a spell this morning.
There’s the pone and some bacon
keeping warm for you by the fire.”</p>

<p>Puzzled that his grandfather didn’t
take a more active interest in the
calamity that had befallen him,
the boy ran half-dressed to the door.</p>

<p>“Gran’daddy! gran’daddy! what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
you got Bonaparte and Butterfly
geared up to the cart for?”</p>

<p>“I been down to Junaluska.
And now you eat your breakfast
quick, and we’ll go hunt up your
half of the Valley of the Mississippi;
and you put on them blue-top boots
Grover Cleveland; them old shoes
lets the water in.”</p>

<p>“Why them boots is done gone!”
he shook his grandfather as if to
wake him up, “don’t you ’member—oh-ee-ee,”
he went diving under
the bed and, coming up again with
the blue-tops hugged close to his
breast and another pair in his hand,
stood before his grandfather dumb
as to the vocal organs but his eyes
questioning wildly.</p>

<p>“Them red-tops is for Jakey.”</p>

<p>“You aim to carry them boots up
to him, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“No, gran’son, I aim to bring
Jakey down to the boots.”</p>

<p>In the Ledbetter home that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
afternoon Carolina dropped the
broom as two little boys came frolicking
about her, and capturing
the larger one, she squeezed him
rapturously!</p>

<p>“If you ever get out of this house
at night again, Grover Cleveland,”
she said, “you’ll be smarter than I
am; that’s what.”</p>

<p>Autumn in the Southern Appalachians.</p>

<p>The little boy sat on the prize
pumpkin that his grandfather had put
in front of the house to challenge
the comment of passers-by. He was
chewing sorghum-cane and singing
in snatches:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His Aunt Carolina stood on the
porch spinning stocking yarn, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
near her sat his grandfather, cobbling
shoes as diligently and contentedly
as if born and bred to that lowly
occupation instead of being a forehanded
farmer holding county and
township offices.</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland certainly is
a good singer,” said Carolina. “He
can carry the tune of every last
hymn he hears ’em sing down to
church and he can carry the words
too, clean up to twenty verses I
reckon, and what he can’t remember
he can make up.”</p>

<p>The old man laid down his implements,
bowed himself to his
“studyin’” attitude, and looked
fondly and proudly at his grandson.
Carolina let her eyes range the
highroad.</p>

<p>“Here comes old man Sumter
a-drivin’ that ar’ Sal he bought over
to Nantahala. She was round and
plump as ary one of our mules when
he brought her here, but now I declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
she’s the gauntedest mule that travels
the road. I reckon he’s jerked and
jawed the flesh right off her bones.”</p>

<p>“You say Cap’n Sumter’s a-comin’?”
asked her father, and he
got up and went out to the road side.
At his signal his neighbour twitched
Sal to a stand and stared at him
without a relaxing line in his hard
old face or a gleam of friendliness in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Colonel Ledbetter had pleasant
information to impart. He lifted
one foot to the hub of the clumsy
fore wheel, rested an arm across his
knees and looked hard into the sandy
road lest his eyes should forestall
his tongue as the bearer of good news.</p>

<p>“You sold me them ’leven wa’nut
trees on Sundown Hill for thirty
dollars apiece, Cap’n Sumter?”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s ’bout how the
case stands,” the grim face looked
steadily at the smiling one and not
a line softened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir,” the pleasant eyes
looked up with a lively sparkle that
might have been borrowed from
Grover Cleveland’s own, “I hadn’t
examined them trees as close as
I ought to, and ’pears like you hadn’t
either; there’s a little mistake about
one of ’em and I expected we’d
better rectify it right now——”</p>

<p>“G’long!” old man Sumter hit the
mule a “lick,” saying viciously as
she sprang forward, “You got the
timber and I got the money and I
don’t rectify no mistakes now; you’re
old enough to have knowed what
you was gittin’ ’fore you paid for
it.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ as you please Sam Sumter,
jes’ as you please”; the indignant
old gentleman made a gesture as
one who gladly washes his hands
of a responsibility and yielding to
curiosity Sumter turned toward
him.</p>

<p>Colonel Ledbetter didn’t pause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
in his slow walk toward the house
but he said in a tone of supreme
indifference:</p>

<p>“I’ve had my men up there
a-fellin’ them trees and the biggest of
’em, the one furthest up the hill,
is a curly walnut. Five years ago
I sold one like it for twelve hundred
dollars and I could have give you
points ’bout sellin’ yours; but seein’
you don’t rectify no mistakes, why
that’s all there is about it and we’ll
stick to the bargain.”</p>

<p>Again Sal was jerked to a stand
and twisting round on a pivotal
hand pressed to the seat, old man
Sumter regarded his interlocutor
with intense concern. But Colonel
Ledbetter proceeded to the house
without looking right or left and,
disappointed and ireful, his neighbour
went on his way.</p>

<p>Colonel Ledbetter resumed his
seat and his grandson came and
leaned against him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Looks like he’s plumb mad,
gran’daddy.”</p>

<p>“Yes he is, Grover Cleveland,
he’s plumb mad and he’s been so
ever since I’ve knowed him and
that’s mighty nigh sixty years.
He’s so rarin’ mad that when the
Lord throws a good thing in his way
he’s too mad to see it. Now like
that ar wa’nut; any man that was
a-lookin’ out for virtues instid of
<em>de</em>fects would have discovered that
’twas a curly. But old man Sumter’s
mad at every thing under the
sun whether it’s human or beast or
tree or stone; and he’s mad at ’em
all the time and he’s so mad that
he won’t take no notice to ’em.
Jes’ like he wouldn’t take notice to
me jes’ now, when I was goin’ to
put more than a thousand dollars
right into his hand; it would mighty
nigh paid off that ar mortgage
that he’s been skinnin’ himself
to pay int’rest on these twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
years—for he jes’ keeps a-goin’
behind and a-goin’ behind for no
airthly reason that I can see but
jes’ ’cause he’s so mad all the time
that he can’t study any of the arts
of peace. Why his very crops fails
because he hates ’em so. Grover
Cleveland, don’t you never go to
bein’ mad at every body all the time.
Tain’t Christian, an’ more’n that it
kind o’ spiles your aim so that you
don’t bring down no game.”</p>

<p>“Was he borned that-a-way,
gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“I expect he was, Grover Cleveland,
I expect he was.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty sorry for him”; the
little fellow twisted his hands together
and looked afar; “it’s powerful
mizzable to be borned with ways
that you can’t help.”</p>

<p>The old man’s attention and
sympathy were his in an instant.
“Don’t you go to takin’ on about
sleep walkin’, Grover Cleveland,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
he said drawing his arm tightly
about the child; “you’re bound to
outgrow that before long.”</p>

<p>“I paid him,” the old man went
on addressing his daughter, “I paid
him more for them trees than ary
other somebody had offered him,
jes’ because I was willin’ to help
make up to him the loss of his barn
that burnt down; but he didn’ thank
me for it.”</p>

<p>“What’s curly wa’nuts good for,
gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“They’re good for veneerin’,
Grover Cleveland. You see this is
how ’tis: they don’t saw the logs
through like they do down to Campbell’s
saw-mill but they saw ’em,
round and round, into sheets mighty
nigh as thin as writin’-paper. There
hadn’t ought to be any cuts or holes
in the log, so that they can make
big smooth sheets of it, and they’ll
saw that log up till there ain’t a
core left that’s as thick as my arm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“What can they make out of
timber as thin as writin’-paper,
gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>Then to the extent of his own
imperfect knowledge of the veneering
process, the old man explained
it to the child.</p>

<p>“So far as I know, there’s only
three veneering mills in the country.
When I sold my tree I wrote a letter
to all three of ’em and told ’em what
I had to sell and they wrote back
and made me a offer—only that
Kentucky fellow, he’s the nearest
by and he made out like he had
business in this direction and he
stopped round to see it; and ’twas
him I sold the tree to.</p>

<p>“And I aimed to work it jes’
that-a-way for Cap’n Sumter; I
aimed to write the letters for him—for
he ain’t a mite handy with a
pen, Sam Sumter ain’t (a education
is a mighty handy thing to get hold
of Grover Cleveland), and get in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the three bids for the tree and let
him take up with ary one he see fit.”</p>

<p>“You’ve sure done your duty by
him now, daddy,” said Carolina,
“and that tree is yours anyway
you can fix it.”</p>

<p>“<em>Is</em> it yours, gran’daddy?”</p>

<p>“It’s mine by rule o’ law, Grover
Cleveland, but I don’t know as it’s
mine by that ar golden rule that
you and Preacher Carr let on to
know so much about.”</p>

<p>His doting grandparent considered
the child a prodigy of ethical
understanding, or “jedgment,” as
he would have expressed it, and,
although he was continually plying
him with information and advice
on all sorts of subjects, it was
no uncommon thing for him to
consult the little fellow even in
matters of moment. It was as if
he stored his maxims and admonitions
into the laboratory of the
child’s mind and then requisitioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
it for them in convenient form for
practical use.</p>

<p>“What’s your opinion, Grover
Cleveland?’”</p>

<p>The child hesitated, his bright face
raised earnestly to the grizzled one:</p>

<p>“Me and you, gran’daddy, me
and you, we don’t want anything
that ain’t sure ’nough ours; do we?”</p>

<p>“<em>No-o sir-ee!</em> That settles it,
Carliny; Grover Cleveland and me
we want a golden rule title to every
thing we claim.”</p>

<p>So Colonel Ledbetter got his ink
bottle and pen off the shelf, a sheet and
a half of writing-paper out of the front
of the Bible, and three envelopes out
of the back, and laboriously indited
the letters to the veneering mills, while
out in the shadow of the prize pumpkin
his grandson cracked butternuts
for the tame gray squirrels. But all
the while new ideas were whirling
through the little boy’s head, and they
concentred in that curly walnut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>That night “when there was
naught but starre light” a little
human figure, bareheaded, barefooted,
and clad in a single, loosely
hanging garment came out of the
Ledbetter house. It proceeded
noiselessly, though without stealth,
for it kept in the open, taking the
middle of the road with a free and
fearless tread. Though the eyes were
partly shut and the night was dark,
it made no false or stumbling step;
some intuition or spiritual sight or
maybe an angelic presence was guiding
it. Dixie came yawning and
stretching to the edge of the porch,
settled meditatively upon his
haunches, watched it to the first
bend in the road, then followed boundingly
until he came abreast when, demurely
dropping head and tail, he
fell behind but kept so close that
the little wind-blown shirt fluttered
in his face.</p>

<p>When half a mile had been travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
a branching wagon track, scarcely
discernible even in the daytime, led
up to some bars in the worm-fence
that outlined the road. The little
dreamer climbed over and took the
rough road beyond without a sign
of doubt or hesitation. It zigzagged
through the woods but
steadily upward to where those walnut
trees, with a goodly company
of peers, oak, chestnut, and whitewood
had crowned a summit. He
had followed it a few times before,
but wide-awake beside his grandfather
in the ox wagon, with Butterfly
and Bonaparte for motive power.
It was overgrown with grass and
weeds that shed their dew upon
his little feet and perfumed them
with pennyroyal and dittany, while
overhead interweaving branches hid
even the stars from sight.</p>

<p>Though tempted from duty’s path
by many a springing cotton tail,
Dixie kept close behind his master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
until the sound of an axe came
thudding through the forest, at
which he cocked his remnant
for ears, stood for a second on
the <em>qui vive</em>, then shot away in the
direction of the sound.</p>

<p>He returned panting and, planting
himself in front of the little sleepwalker,
tried to head him in a different
direction, but the child only
swerved and continued his upward
course. Again the dog headed him
off, again and again until he had
turned him quite out of the road way,
but the boy threaded his way through
undergrowth and over rocks and
hummocks as easily as if he had been
of spiritual rather than material
substance.</p>

<p>Finally Dixie grabbed in his teeth
the border of the little shirt and
tugged so lustily that his master
could not advance a single step
farther, and as he tugged he whined
in thorough frenzy; and if his language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
could have been rendered
into the vernacular it would have
been:</p>

<p>“There’s danger ahead, Grover
Cleveland! There’s a bad old man
up there, a man that never sees me
without making a lick at me with
his stick, and if he does you mean
and there’s only I left to tell the
tale, who’ll I tell it to, I’d like to
know? for there’s not a human
that’s smart enough to understand
<em>my</em> language, though I’ve understood
English ever since I was a
pup. Come back, Grover Cleveland!
<em>come back, I say, come back!</em>”
and with that last “come back,”
Dixie gave such a sudden and powerful
jerk that Grover Cleveland
came tumbling backward into a
bed of galax.</p>

<p>He righted himself and sat there
with a hand on either side pressing
the leaves down into the turf, the
dog crouched close with his paws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
across the little bare knees and his
tongue spasmodically licking the bewildered
face.</p>

<p>The child heaved a slow, sobbing
sigh or two and became his conscious
self, a little boy alone at night in
the dark, silent woods, frightened,
not by darkness or silence or apprehension
of danger, but by the
thought of that mysterious power
that could convey him so far from
home and gran’daddy, and Aunt
Carliny without any of their knowledge
or consent. So he laid his
head upon Dixie’s neck and cried it
out and then got upon his feet,
once more a practical little mountaineer
with a mind curious to see
and to understand, a loving heart
and willing, eager little hands and
feet to wait upon its promptings.</p>

<p>He knew that downward must be
homeward and cautiously (less confident
now than when guided by
that unconscious mentality) he began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
to grope for his footing. Then again
the sound of that axe came cleaving
the silence and this time Grover
Cleveland heard it as plainly as
Dixie did.</p>

<p>He turned to investigate the phenomenon,
Dixie following contentedly
now that his master was himself
again. The undergrowth had become
thinner as they had ascended and soon
they came out where great trees rose
in stately exclusiveness unintruded
upon by lesser growths. Here the
darkness was less dense, stars looked
down through rifts in the leafy
canopy, and a little farther up the
hill one fixed star gleamed scarcely
eight feet from the ground as if intercepted
upon an earthward trip and
impaled upon a bough. It dispensed
only a dim circle of light,
but in it the boy could discern the
figure of the wood chopper, could
even catch an occasional glint reflected
from the blade of the swinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
axe. He had come up against
a fallen tree and he climbed up and
sat upon the trunk, hugging his
knees while he peered into the gloom.</p>

<p>All at once a suspicion of his
whereabouts entered his head and
to confirm it he got off the log and
made his way to its larger end.
Yes, there stood the stump from
which it had been cut but recently
and green chips littered the ground.
He explored farther. Nearby lay
another log, just over there another—why
they were all about him!
He knew perfectly well where he
was. On old man Sumter’s hill
and these were his grandfather’s
walnut trees!</p>

<p>But that man! Why was he here
in the dark, dark night chopping
away with might and main? The
boy made his way toward him,
Dixie quiet but alert and as full of
curiosity as his master.</p>

<p>That star was a lantern pendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
from a chestnut limb; its light shone
upon the man’s face. Why it was
old man Sumter himself! and that
log was the curly walnut, for it was
the one highest on the hillside, and
he was gashing it all along its length!
And he was right mad at that curly
too (just like gran’daddy said he was
always mad at everything), for he
kept talking right ugly to it!</p>

<p>“Hi!” the child sprang forward
shouting to the full capacity of his
sturdy lungs and caught the old
man by the coat tails. “Wake up!
oh, wake up! Don’t you see what
you’re a-doin’!”</p>

<p>Grover Cleveland tugged and
shouted, Dixie barked and leaped
and growled and the echoes multiplied
the tumult. Stunned by the
suddenness of the attack the old man
let the axe slip from his hand and
backed round against the log. He
was feeble, he had been exerting
himself beyond his strength and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
was frightened too—had it not
been for Dixie’s very earthly performance
he would have been sure
he had met up with a ha’nt.</p>

<p>“What be you anyway?” he asked
quaveringly, sinking to a seat upon
the log.</p>

<p>“Why I’m Grover Cleveland,
gran’daddy’s grandson.”</p>

<p>The boy looked the man over with
a face full of compassion. Here was
a big man afflicted just as he was,
and that fellow-feeling that makes
us all so wondrous kind enthralled
him.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re broad awake
now?” he asked coming very close
and laying his hand upon the old
man’s knee. “It’s awful to walk
in your sleep; I feel mighty sorry
for you.” He scrambled up on the
log, wriggled himself as close to the
night-walker as he could get, took
a coarse, limp old hand in his, and
patted it. “I certainly am sorry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>for you ’cause I know jes’ how it
feels to be woked up in the dark,
away off from home and not know
how you got there. I walk in my
sleep too—that’s how I come out
yer to-night—but you’ve got it
worse than me, you have; for I
don’t do mischief when I’m took,
but you—why-e-e-e!” twisting
himself about and surveying the
log—“you’ve done hacked your
tree all to pieces and ’twon’t be
no more good for veneerin’! Gran’daddy
says they don’t want nary
snag in it.</p>

to a seat upon the log.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“But maybe this ain’t the curly,”
he peered eagerly into the woods;
“it ain’t ’less it’s the furtherest
one up.”</p>

<p>“This is the curly wa’nut all
right,” growled Sumter with a malevolent
twang unintelligible to the
child.</p>

<p>“I certainly am sorry for you.
Gran’daddy wrote three letters ’bout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
this yer tree and he was goin’ to
turn the answers over to you so’t
you could take up with ary one
you’d a mind to—that’s what he
said——”</p>

<p>“You say he did? Didn’t he
’low he’d bought the tree fair
’nough?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t the way he thought
about it—and me and gran’daddy,
you know, we don’t want anything
that ain’t sure ’nough ours; he
said you could sell it for enough
money to pay all you owed. He
was plumb glad of it and now he’ll
be mighty nigh as sorry as you and
me is.”</p>

<p>For a moment sad, silent thought
held sway.</p>

<p>“There’s one good thing about it
though,” the child tucked his garment
tightly under his knees, “you
don’t get out without dressin’ yourself,
the way I do; you ought to be
glad about that. Gran’daddy says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
there’s always some good even in
the baddest things if we watch out
for it.”</p>

<p>His companion made no response
and the boy resumed his role of
sympathizer.</p>

<p>“I reckon you was borned that-a-way,
jes’ like me, and it’s powerful
mizzable to be borned with ways
that you can’t help; and you ain’t
got any Dixie to watch out for you.
And Aunt Carliny, she makes me
sleep with her and Jakey, so’s she
can catch me at it, but I don’t guess
you’ve got any Aunt Carliny either.”</p>

<p>“Naw,” old man Sumter got up
and reached for his lantern, “I ain’t
got nary somebody that cares what
becomes of me.”</p>

<p>The boy got down off the log and
pityingly took his hand.</p>

<p>“Le’s go home,” he said, “I know
where I be now an’ if you’re kind
o’ mixed up yet, why I can show
you the trail,” and he led away as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
shamefaced an old sinner as ever
trod the mountains.</p>

<p>(Seeing the pair on friendly terms,
Dixie indulged in a brief interview
with a ’possum.)</p>

<p>“As I was a-sayin’,” comforted
the child as they picked their way
by the lantern’s light, “it’s powerful
mizzable to be borned with ways
that you can’t help; but don’t you
go to takin’-on about it, for we’re
bound to outgrow it—so gran’daddy
says. And there’s another
thing where you’re worse off than
me: gran’daddy says you was borned
mad at everybody all the time—that
must be powerful mizzable too,
but I reckon you’ll outgrow that too.”</p>

<p>They parted at Sumter’s door
and then Grover Cleveland and
Dixie sped homeward. Noiselessly
the little fellow entered the house,
crept into bed beside his Aunt
Carliny and straightway forgot his
“mizzable” inheritance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>But he had it embarrassingly recalled
to his mind next morning
at breakfast when Aunt Carliny
said as she gave him his second
helping of hominy:</p>

<p>“Grover Cleveland’s getting right
good ’bout stayin’ in bed o’ nights;
he ain’t tried to get up in a dog’s
age. Of course he couldn’t get up
without my catchin’ him, for I’m
always sleepin’ with one eye open, but
seem like he don’t try any more.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s outgrowin’ them
kind of capers,” gran’daddy reached
out, stroked the yellow pate and
the yellow pate bent lower and
lower and finally the whole boy
went down under the table.</p>

<p>He next appeared tagging dumbly
at the heels of the old gentleman as
he was making his morning tour
among his stock, who, when a sudden
turn brought them into collision,
reached behind him and brought
the boy out of his obscurity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“’Pears like you ain’t a mite peart
this morning, Grover Cleveland; you
got something on your mind?”</p>

<p>The child bored the soil with
his toes:</p>

<p>“I—wasn’t in bed <em>all</em> night,
gran’daddy, not <em>every minute</em>, I
wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You been a-walkin’ in your
sleep again?”</p>

<p>The child nodded guiltily and a
very awkward pause ensued. Gran’daddy
looked serious, but as soon
as distressful symptoms began to
develop in the little culprit, he applied,
as usual, the healing balm of consolation.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t take-on about it,
Grover Cleveland, not a mite, I
wouldn’t, for you’re plumb sure to
outgrow it. Gran’daddy used to
be up to them same tricks but he’s
outgrowed ’em. I jes’ go to bed
and I lay there as firm as a island
in a goose pond and you couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
drag me out—not with Butterfly
and Bonaparte you couldn’t—not
unless something was the matter with
Grover Cleveland and <em>he</em> wanted
me in the night; if he did, if he ever
does, I’ll shoot out of that bed like
lightning out of a thunder cloud.”
And so he coaxed and petted until the
shamed little face was ready to look
the world squarely in the eyes again.</p>

<p>“Where was you at, last night, eh?”</p>

<p>“When I come to, I was up to
Sundown Hill where them wa’nut
trees is.”</p>

<p>“Was you ’way off there, grandson?”
Gran’daddy settled to a
seat on a wagon tongue and put a
snug arm about the boy who grew
suddenly voluble in the recollection
of stirring times.</p>

<p>“Hi, gran’daddy! Cap’n Sumter,
<em>he</em> walks in his sleep jes’ like me!
He does a heap of things in his sleep!
An’ he talks right out loud too;
that’s a heap worse’n me, ain’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“If he does it, it’s a heap worse’n
you. Did you meet up with him
last night?”</p>

<p>“Why he was a-doin’ mischief,
<em>he</em> was! He was choppin’ up that
ar curly wa’nut and every lick he
hit, he says, ‘<em>Now</em> will you
bring twelve-hundred dollars for
veneerin,’ and he chopped big holes
in it!”</p>

<p>“<em>That curly?</em>”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s, that ar one that lays
furtherest up the hill.”</p>

<p>The old man loosened his hold of
the lad and rose slowly to his feet, a
look on his face that Grover Cleveland
had never seen there before
and that he could only vaguely
interpret, but it made him feel sorry
for his companion in misery. So he
took his grandfather’s hand and as
they walked toward the house he
discoursed:</p>

<p>“He can’t help doin’ things in
his sleep for he was borned that-a-way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and he can’t help bein’ mad
all the time for he was borned that-a-way
too; and I reckon he feels
mighty shamed of hisself now—that’s
the way I feel.”</p>

<p>Receiving no response he squeezed
the hand he held in both his own
demanding recognition of his reiterated
sentiment:</p>

<p>“It’s powerful mizzable to be
borned with ways that you can’t help.”</p>

<p>And gran’daddy replied:</p>

<p>“So it is, Grover Cleveland, so
it is.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For two or three days the lives
of our heroes ran along in the usual
quiet channels, and then one morning
Colonel Ledbetter drove up in
front of Captain Sumter’s broken-spirited-looking
dwelling-place. On
the seat beside him was a “city-dressed
fellow” and Grover Cleveland
swung his legs over the pendant
tail board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>In response to a call old man
Sumter appeared.</p>

<p>“This yer man” (the mountaineer
is apt to be off-hand in his introductions),
“is the owner of that veneerin’
mill in Kentucky. He’s
come to look at that ar curly wa’nut
and to make you a offer for it; and
here’s two letters from two other
men that runs that kind of mills.
One of ’em bids ’leven-hundred-an’-fifty
dollars for it and the other a
hundred or two more.”</p>

<p>Sumter fumbled with the letters,
affecting even more than his habitual
gruffness.</p>

<p>“Looks like you ain’t been to look
at your property lately. That ar
curly wa’nut ain’t no good for veneerin’
nor nothin’ else; it’s done
chopped to pieces.”</p>

<p>Apparently his neighbour was
absorbed in switching a fly off the
white mule’s back, for he replied
with his eye following the fly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“I was up thar yesterday evening
an ’twas all right then. You jump
in thar ’long side of my boy and
we’ll go up and look at it,” and the
embarrassed old man got in because
he didn’t know what else to do
or what to say.</p>

<p>When next they halted they were
among the felled trees. It was
strange, but Colonel Ledbetter’s eyes
never happened to light on that
scarred log as he led his party past
it and toward the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>“There’s only ten trees lying
here,” he said, “that curly I left
standing. Sometimes the man that
buys it will give more for it that-a-way
because he wants to have it
cut particular; sometimes they count
on gettin’ root and all.”</p>

<p>“Thar she is neighbour,” he said
to the Kentuckian, slapping the old
tree’s sides as proudly as if it had
been a three-year-old thoroughbred
and his own, “and if you don’t ’low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
she’s a giant and a beauty, you want
to go out of the lumber business.”</p>

<p>He waited to hear his sentiment
confirmed and then hand in hand
with his grandson walked away leaving
Sumter to make his own bargain.</p>

<p>“You see, Grover Cleveland,” he
said as they came up to the hacked
log, “he was too mad to see straight
and he lit on the wrong tree.”</p>

<p>“Why gran’daddy, he was walkin’
in his sleep!”</p>

<p>“Sure ’nough; gran’daddy plumb
forgot <em>that</em> part of the story”—he
sorted some chips about with the
toe of his boot—“but, Grover
Cleveland, don’t you never go to
actin’ <em>that</em> spiteful, sleepin’ or
wakin’.”</p>

<p>Two days afterward Sal stood
sampling a pile of choice limber-twigs
while her master sat on the
Ledbetter porch. It is difficult to
describe the expression of his hard
old face. Its obduracy was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
but less marked; as if a thin lava-flow
of astonishment had hardened
upon his features.</p>

<p>“That thar feller,” he said, “’lowed
me fo’teen hundred dollars for the
curly wa’nut and yesterday evening
I druv over to the cou’t-house and—nary
man’s got a nickel’s worth
of claim on my farm now.”</p>

<p>Colonel Ledbetter grabbed his
hand and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>“I certainly am glad, Sam,” he
said, “I certainly am.”</p>

<p>“Looks like you think as you
say, Jake.” The old fellow hoisted
himself on his feet and, after the
distortions of figure necessary to
get possession of his pocket-book,
said: “Here’s the thirty dollars
you give me for the curly and here’s
another thirty for the log that got
hacked.” Without another word he
stumped clumsily out to his wagon,
Colonel Ledbetter following in a
neighbourly way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a fine heifer you’ve got
tied behind, Sam; tollable much
Holstein in her, ain’t there?”</p>

<p>“Looks like thar is; g’long!”</p>

<p>He turned into the road, but a
second thought made him look
back.</p>

<p>“See here”; Colonel Ledbetter
went to him.</p>

<p>“That thar line fence that Higgins
has been a-snarlin’ ’bout for twenty
year—he says it b’longs on my side
the branch. It was on yon side
when the property come into my
hands but, ’cordin’ to the records
over to the cou’t-house, looks like
there’s a chance of him bein’ in the
right of it. And I’m like you and
Grover Cleveland, Jake; I don’t
want nothin’ ’tain’t mine. I don’t
reckon Higgins’ll have anything to
say to me, but if you’re a mind to go
over and talk to him ’bout it, we’ll
have it straightened out. G’long.”</p>

<p>Over the hill he went, jerked Sal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to a stand in front of Mis’ Jimson’s
log-cabin, clambered out of the
wagon, and began to untie the cow.
The old woman came limping down
the walk with surprise but no welcome
in her face.</p>

<p>“Where’ll you have her?” he
asked with his eyes on his fingers.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean, Sam
Sumter?”</p>

<p>“Mis’ Jimson, you ’lowed I’d
put my brand onto the ears of your
calf. This ’ere creeter run with mine
up on the mounting the whole season
and when they brought my
cattle down she was with ’em; but if
you say she’s yours——”</p>

<p>“She <em>is</em> mine, I know her by the
shape of the white blanket on her
back. ’Tain’t hard to know your
own when one is all you’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Here she is,” he opened the
gate, put the animal into the yard
and had regained his seat before
she recovered her speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“How’s all the folks, Cap’n
Sumter?”</p>

<p>“Tollable; g’long!”</p>

<p>The cow was too wild to let her
mistress come near so she stood and
admired her afar off:</p>

<p>“Looks like the millenyum has
done come,” she said, “and I’m
mighty glad I’ve lived to see it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Well what about it!” exclaimed
Aunt Dicey the next Sunday, pointing
to her dingy little wooden clock,
“she’s done stopped—a hour ago
for all I know. We’ll be late to
church an’ I wouldn’t miss what
Preacher Carr has got to say this
mornin’—not for a pretty. Why,
Zeb’lon, they’re a-sayin’ that ole
man Sumter’s sure ’nough got religion!”</p>

<p>“You say he has!” Zeb’s tone
was as wrathy as it was incredulous.</p>

<p>“Sure ’nough; Mis’ Campbell
says he’s a-restorin’ fourfold!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Thar’s the old sinner now,”
grumbled Zeb; “talk about good
folks and they’re plumb sure to
heave into sight.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about it? He’s
a-drivin’ up!”</p>

<p>“Hullo in there! Zeb’lon!”</p>

<p>Just within the door but out of
the old man’s sight, Aunt Dicey
counseled her grandson:</p>

<p>“You speak him fair, Zeb’lon,
for they say he sure has got religion;
but I’ll stand on the porch with the
gun whar he can see me good; maybe
that’ll keep him from backslidin’
all of a suddent.”</p>

<p>They went out together. Zeb
said “Mornin’” but his tone was
not conciliatory.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a mighty pretty year-old
colt up to my place; come of
first-class Kentucky stock. If you’re
a mind to, you can come up and git
him, to pay for that thar tame deer I
shot. G’long!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Church was “in” when Aunt
Dicey and Zeb drove up, and before
they had alighted and found a place
to hitch among the two score beasts
of draught or burden that were disposed
in the surrounding woods,
church was “out.” But the congregation
didn’t disperse; they stood
about in groups discussing the
wonderful events of the past week.
Preacher Carr came and stood in
the doorway:</p>

<p>“Give me that old-time religion,”
he sang out lustily, and his people
joined joyously in the refrain. Arsula
Garrett always led the singing
and she followed him with:</p>

<p>“It was good for the Hebrew
children,” and they kept on chanting
the efficacy of the “old-time religion”
in the case of “the prophet
Daniel,” “the good Elijah,” “the
psalmist David,” “poor old Noah,”
“the patriarch Abr’ham,” and,
when they had exhausted Arsula’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
list of sacred-history heroes, they
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It was good for my old mother,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“It will be good in the time of trouble,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“It will be good when the world’s on fire,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and finally they rounded up the
catalogue of human experiences and
human apprehensions with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It will be good when I am dying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">It is good enough for me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Grover Cleveland wasn’t
ready to go home yet and, tugging
at Arsula’s skirt, he piped timorously:</p>

<p>“It will be good while I’m
a-livin,”—probably it was only dislike
of the thought of dying that
inspired his improvisation, but
Arsula and the rest took it up with
all their heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It will be good while I am living,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">It is good enough for me.”</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
